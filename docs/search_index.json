Love, Ph.D. Built 2018-04-21 11:41:51 Introduction These Notes provide a series of examples using R to work through issues that are likely to come up in PQHS/CRSP/MPHP 432. While these Notes share some of the features of a textbook, they are neither comprehensive nor completely original. The main purpose is to give students in 432 a set of common materials on which to draw during the course. In class, we will sometimes: reiterate points made in this document, amplify what is here, simplify the presentation of things done here, use new examples to show some of the same techniques, refer to issues not mentioned in this document, but what we don’t (always) do is follow these notes very precisely. We assume instead that you will read the materials and try to learn from them, just as you will attend classes and try to learn from them. We welcome feedback of all kinds on this document or anything else. Just email us at 431-help at case dot edu, or submit a pull request. Note that we still use 431-help even though we’re now in 432. What you will mostly find are brief explanations of a key idea or summary, accompanied (most of the time) by R code and a demonstration of the results of applying that code. Everything you see here is available to you as HTML or PDF. You will also have access to the R Markdown files, which contain the code which generates everything in the document, including all of the R results. We will demonstrate the use of R Markdown (this document is generated with the additional help of an R package called bookdown) and R Studio (the “program” which we use to interface with the R language) in class. To download the data and R code related to these notes, visit the Data and Code section of the 432 course website. "],

In 431, we studied numerous methods, including various sorts of hypothesis tests, confidence intervals, and descriptive summaries, which can help us to understand and compare outcomes in such a setting. One common approach is to present what’s often called Table 1. Table 1 provides a summary of the characteristics of a sample, or of groups of samples, which is most commonly used to help understand the nature of the data being compared. 1.1 Two examples from the New England Journal of Medicine 1.1.1 A simple Table 1 Table 1 is especially common in the context of clinical research. Consider the excerpt below, from a January 2015 article in the New England Journal of Medicine (Tolaney et al. 2015). This (partial) table reports baseline characteristics on age group, sex and race, describing 406 patients with HER2-positive1 invasive breast cancer that began the protocol therapy. Age, sex and race (along with severity of illness) are the most commonly identified characteristics in a Table 1. In addition to the measures shown in this excerpt, the full Table also includes detailed information on the primary tumor for each patient, including its size, nodal status and histologic grade. Footnotes tell us that the percentages shown are subject to rounding, and may not total 100, and that the race information was self-reported. 1.1.2 A group comparison A more typical Table 1 involves a group comparison, for example in this excerpt from Roy et al. (2008). This Table 1 describes a multi-center randomized clinical trial comparing two different approaches to caring for patients with heart failure and atrial fibrillation2. The article provides percentages, means and standard deviations across groups, but note that it does not provide p values for the comparison of baseline characteristics. This is a common feature of NEJM reports on randomized clinical trials, where we anticipate that the two groups will be well matched at baseline. Note that the patients in this study were randomly assigned to either the rhythm-control group or to the rate-control group, using blocked randomizations stratified by study center. 1.2 The MR CLEAN trial Berkhemer et al. (2015) reported on the MR CLEAN trial, involving 500 patients with acute ischemic stroke caused by a proximal intracranial arterial occlusion. The trial was conducted at 16 medical centers in the Netherlands, where 233 were randomly assigned to the intervention (intraarterial treatment plus usual care) and 267 to control (usual care alone.) The primary outcome was the modified Rankin scale score at 90 days; this categorical scale measures functional outcome, with scores ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 6 (death). The fundamental conclusion of Berkhemer et al. (2015) was that in patients with acute ischemic stroke caused by a proximal intracranial occlusion of the anterior circulation, intraarterial treatment administered within 6 hours after stroke onset was effective and safe. Here’s the Table 1 from Berkhemer et al. (2015). The Table was accompanied by the following notes. 1.3 Simulated fakestroke data Consider the simulated data, available on the Data and Code page of our course website in the fakestroke.csv file, which I built to let us mirror the Table 1 for MR CLEAN (Berkhemer et al. 2015). The fakestroke.csv file contains the following 18 variables for 500 patients. Variable Description studyid Study ID # (z001 through z500) trt Treatment group (Intervention or Control) age Age in years sex Male or Female nihss NIH Stroke Scale Score (can range from 0-42; higher scores indicate more severe neurological deficits) location Stroke Location - Left or Right Hemisphere hx.isch History of Ischemic Stroke (Yes/No) afib Atrial Fibrillation (1 = Yes, 0 = No) dm Diabetes Mellitus (1 = Yes, 0 = No) mrankin Pre-stroke modified Rankin scale score (0, 1, 2 or &gt; 2) indicating functional disability - complete range is 0 (no symptoms) to 6 (death) sbp Systolic blood pressure, in mm Hg iv.altep Treatment with IV alteplase (Yes/No) time.iv Time from stroke onset to start of IV alteplase (minutes) if iv.altep=Yes aspects Alberta Stroke Program Early Computed Tomography score, which measures extent of stroke from 0 - 10; higher scores indicate fewer early ischemic changes ia.occlus Intracranial arterial occlusion, based on vessel imaging - five categories3 extra.ica Extracranial ICA occlusion (1 = Yes, 0 = No) time.rand Time from stroke onset to study randomization, in minutes time.punc Time from stroke onset to groin puncture, in minutes (only if Intervention) Here’s a quick look at the simulated data in fakestroke. fakestroke # A tibble: 500 x 18 studyid trt age sex nihss location hx.isch afib dm mrankin &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;fct&gt; 1 z001 Control 53.

I’ll use the tableone package of functions available in R to help me complete this task. We’ll make a first attempt, using the CreateTableOne function in the tableone package. To use the function, we’ll need to specify: the vars or variables we want to place in the rows of our Table 1 (which will include just about everything in the fakestroke data except the studyid code and the trt variable for which we have other plans, and the time.punc which applies only to subjects in the Intervention group.) A useful trick here is to use the dput function, specifically something like dput(names(fakestroke)) can be used to generate a list of all of the variables included in the fakestroke tibble, and then this can be copied and pasted into the vars specification, saving some typing. the strata which indicates the levels want to use in the columns of our Table 1 (for us, that’s trt) fs.vars &lt;- c(&quot;age&quot;, &quot;sex&quot;, &quot;nihss&quot;, &quot;location&quot;, &quot;hx.isch&quot;, &quot;afib&quot;, &quot;dm&quot;, &quot;mrankin&quot;, &quot;sbp&quot;, &quot;iv.altep&quot;, &quot;time.iv&quot;, &quot;aspects&quot;, &quot;ia.occlus&quot;, &quot;extra.ica&quot;, &quot;time.rand&quot;) fs.trt &lt;- c(&quot;trt&quot;) att1 &lt;- CreateTableOne(data = fakestroke, vars = fs.vars, strata = fs.trt) print(att1) Stratified by trt Control Intervention p test n 267 233 age (mean (sd)) 65.38 (16.10) 63.93 (18.09) 0.343 sex = Male (%) 157 (58.8) 135 (57.9) 0.917 nihss (mean (sd)) 18.08 (4.32) 17.97 (5.04) 0.787 location = Right (%) 114 (42.7) 117 (50.2) 0.111 hx.isch = Yes (%) 25 ( 9.4) 29 (12.4) 0.335 afib (mean (sd)) 0.26 (0.44) 0.28 (0.45) 0.534 dm (mean (sd)) 0.13 (0.33) 0.12 (0.33) 0.923 mrankin (%) 0.922 &gt; 2 11 ( 4.1) 10 ( 4.3) 0 214 (80.1) 190 (81.5) 1 29 (10.9) 21 ( 9.0) 2 13 ( 4.9) 12 ( 5.2) sbp (mean (sd)) 145.00 (24.40) 146.03 (26.00) 0.647 iv.altep = Yes (%) 242 (90.6) 203 (87.1) 0.267 time.iv (mean (sd)) 87.96 (26.01) 98.22 (45.48) 0.003 aspects (mean (sd)) 8.65 (1.47) 8.35 (1.64) 0.033 ia.occlus (%) 0.795 A1 or A2 2 ( 0.8) 1 ( 0.4) ICA with M1 75 (28.2) 59 (25.3) Intracranial ICA 3 ( 1.1) 1 ( 0.4) M1 165 (62.0) 154 (66.1) M2 21 ( 7.9) 18 ( 7.7) extra.ica (mean (sd)) 0.26 (0.44) 0.32 (0.47) 0.150 time.rand (mean (sd)) 213.88 (70.29) 202.51 (57.33) 0.051 1.4.1 Some of this is very useful, and other parts need to be fixed. The 1/0 variables (afib, dm, extra.ica) might be better if they were treated as the factors they are, and reported as the Yes/No variables are reported, with counts and percentages rather than with means and standard deviations. In some cases, we may prefer to re-order the levels of the categorical (factor) variables, particularly the mrankin variable, but also the ia.occlus variable. It would also be more typical to put the Intervention group to the left and the Control group to the right, so we may need to adjust our trt variable’s levels accordingly. For each of the quantitative variables (age, nihss, sbp, time.iv, aspects, extra.ica, time.rand and time.punc) we should make a decision whether a summary with mean and standard deviation is appropriate, or whether we should instead summarize with, say, the median and quartiles. A mean and standard deviation really only yields an appropriate summary when the data are least approximately Normally distributed. This will make the p values a bit more reasonable, too. The test column in the first attempt will soon have something useful to tell us. If we’d left in the time.punc variable, we’d get some warnings, having to do with the fact that time.punc is only relevant to patients in the Intervention group. 1.4.2 fakestroke Cleaning Up Categorical Variables Let’s specify each of the categorical variables as categorical explicitly. This helps the CreateTableOne function treat them appropriately, and display them with counts and percentages. This includes all of the 1/0, Yes/No and multi-categorical variables. fs.factorvars &lt;- c(&quot;sex&quot;, &quot;location&quot;, &quot;hx.isch&quot;, &quot;afib&quot;, &quot;dm&quot;, &quot;mrankin&quot;, &quot;iv.altep&quot;, &quot;ia.occlus&quot;, &quot;extra.ica&quot;) Then we simply add a factorVars = fs.factorvars call to the CreateTableOne function. We also want to re-order some of those categorical variables, so that the levels are more useful to us. Specifically, we want to: place Intervention before Control in the trt variable, reorder the mrankin scale as 0, 1, 2, &gt; 2, and rearrange the ia.occlus variable to the order4 presented in Berkhemer et al. (2015). To accomplish this, we’ll use the fct_relevel function from the forcats package (loaded with the rest of the core tidyverse packages) to reorder our levels manually. fakestroke &lt;- fakestroke %&gt;% mutate(trt = fct_relevel(trt, &quot;Intervention&quot;, &quot;Control&quot;), mrankin = fct_relevel(mrankin, &quot;0&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;&gt; 2&quot;), ia.occlus = fct_relevel(ia.occlus, &quot;Intracranial ICA&quot;, &quot;ICA with M1&quot;, &quot;M1&quot;, &quot;M2&quot;, &quot;A1 or A2&quot;) ) 1.5 fakestroke Table 1: Attempt 2 att2 &lt;- CreateTableOne(data = fakestroke, vars = fs.vars, factorVars = fs.factorvars, strata = fs.trt) print(att2) Stratified by trt Intervention Control p test n 233 267 age (mean (sd)) 63.93 (18.09) 65.38 (16.10) 0.343 sex = Male (%) 135 (57.9) 157 (58.8) 0.917 nihss (mean (sd)) 17.97 (5.04) 18.08 (4.32) 0.787 location = Right (%) 117 (50.2) 114 (42.7) 0.111 hx.isch = Yes (%) 29 (12.4) 25 ( 9.4) 0.335 afib = 1 (%) 66 (28.3) 69 (25.8) 0.601 dm = 1 (%) 29 (12.4) 34 (12.7) 1.000 mrankin (%) 0.922 0 190 (81.5) 214 (80.1) 1 21 ( 9.0) 29 (10.9) 2 12 ( 5.2) 13 ( 4.9) &gt; 2 10 ( 4.3) 11 ( 4.1) sbp (mean (sd)) 146.03 (26.00) 145.00 (24.40) 0.647 iv.altep = Yes (%) 203 (87.1) 242 (90.6) 0.267 time.iv (mean (sd)) 98.22 (45.48) 87.96 (26.01) 0.003 aspects (mean (sd)) 8.35 (1.64) 8.65 (1.47) 0.033 ia.occlus (%) 0.795 Intracranial ICA 1 ( 0.4) 3 ( 1.1) ICA with M1 59 (25.3) 75 (28.2) M1 154 (66.1) 165 (62.0) M2 18 ( 7.7) 21 ( 7.9) A1 or A2 1 ( 0.4) 2 ( 0.8) extra.ica = 1 (%) 75 (32.2) 70 (26.3) 0.179 time.rand (mean (sd)) 202.51 (57.33) 213.88 (70.29) 0.051 The categorical data presentation looks much improved. 1.5.1 What summaries should we show? Now, we’ll move on to the issue of making a decision about what type of summary to show for the quantitative variables. Since the fakestroke data are just simulated and only match the summary statistics of the original results, not the details, we’ll adopt the decisions made by Berkhemer et al. (2015), which were to use medians and interquartile ranges to summarize the distributions of all of the continuous variables except systolic blood pressure. Specifying certain quantitative variables as non-normal causes R to show them with medians and the 25th and 75th percentiles, rather than means and standard deviations, and also causes those variables to be tested using non-parametric tests, like the Wilcoxon signed rank test, rather than the t test. The test column indicates this with the word nonnorm. In real data situations, what should we do? The answer is to look at the data. I would not make the decision as to which approach to take without first plotting (perhaps in a histogram or a Normal Q-Q plot) the observed distributions in each of the two samples, so that I could make a sound decision about whether Normality was a reasonable assumption. If the means and medians are meaningfully different from each other, this is especially important. To be honest, though, if the variable in question is a relatively unimportant covariate and the p values for the two approaches are nearly the same, I’d say that further investigation is rarely important, Specifying exact tests for certain categorical variables (we’ll try this for the location and mrankin variables) can be done, and these changes will be noted in the test column, as well. In real data situations, I would rarely be concerned about this issue, and often choose Pearson (approximate) options across the board. This is reasonable so long as the number of subjects falling in each category is reasonably large, say above 10. If not, then an exact test may be a tiny improvement. Paraphrasing Rosenbaum (2017), having an exact rather than an approximate test result is about as valuable as having a nice crease in your trousers. To finish our Table 1, then, we need to specify which variables should be treated as non-Normal in the print statement - notice that we don’t need to redo the CreateTableOne for this change. print(att2, nonnormal = c(&quot;age&quot;, &quot;nihss&quot;, &quot;time.iv&quot;, &quot;aspects&quot;, &quot;time.rand&quot;), exact = c(&quot;location&quot;, &quot;mrankin&quot;)) Stratified by trt Intervention Control n 233 267 age (median [IQR]) 65.80 [54.50, 76.00] 65.70 [55.75, 76.20] sex = Male (%) 135 (57.9) 157 (58.8) nihss (median [IQR]) 17.00 [14.00, 21.00] 18.00 [14.00, 22.00] location = Right (%) 117 (50.2) 114 (42.7) hx.isch = Yes (%) 29 (12.4) 25 ( 9.4) afib = 1 (%) 66 (28.3) 69 (25.8) dm = 1 (%) 29 (12.4) 34 (12.7) mrankin (%) 0 190 (81.5) 214 (80.1) 1 21 ( 9.0) 29 (10.9) 2 12 ( 5.2) 13 ( 4.9) &gt; 2 10 ( 4.3) 11 ( 4.1) sbp (mean (sd)) 146.03 (26.00) 145.00 (24.40) iv.altep = Yes (%) 203 (87.1) 242 (90.6) time.iv (median [IQR]) 85.00 [67.00, 110.00] 87.00 [65.00, 116.00] aspects (median [IQR]) 9.00 [7.00, 10.00] 9.00 [8.00, 10.00] ia.occlus (%) Intracranial ICA 1 ( 0.4) 3 ( 1.1) ICA with M1 59 (25.3) 75 (28.2) M1 154 (66.1) 165 (62.0) M2 18 ( 7.7) 21 ( 7.9) A1 or A2 1 ( 0.4) 2 ( 0.8) extra.ica = 1 (%) 75 (32.2) 70 (26.3) time.rand (median [IQR]) 204.00 [152.00, 249.50] 196.00 [149.00, 266.00] Stratified by trt p test n age (median [IQR]) 0.579 nonnorm sex = Male (%) 0.917 nihss (median [IQR]) 0.453 nonnorm location = Right (%) 0.106 exact hx.isch = Yes (%) 0.335 afib = 1 (%) 0.601 dm = 1 (%) 1.000 mrankin (%) 0.917 exact 0 1 2 &gt; 2 sbp (mean (sd)) 0.647 iv.altep = Yes (%) 0.267 time.iv (median [IQR]) 0.596 nonnorm aspects (median [IQR]) 0.075 nonnorm ia.occlus (%) 0.795 Intracranial ICA ICA with M1 M1 M2 A1 or A2 extra.ica = 1 (%) 0.179 time.rand (median [IQR]) 0.251 nonnorm 1.6 Obtaining a more detailed Summary If this was a real data set, we’d want to get a more detailed description of the data to make decisions about things like potentially collapsing categories of a variable, or whether or not a normal distribution was useful for a particular continuous variable, etc. You can do this with the summary command applied to a created Table 1, which shows, among other things, the effect of changing from normal to non-normal p values for continuous variables, and from approximate to “exact” p values for categorical factors. Again, as noted above, in a real data situation, we’d want to plot the quantitative variables (within each group) to make a smart decision about whether a t test or Wilcoxon approach is more appropriate. Note in the summary below that we have some missing values here. Often, we’ll present this information within the Table 1, as well. summary(att2) ### Summary of continuous variables ### trt: Intervention n miss p.miss mean sd median p25 p75 min max skew kurt age 233 0 0.0 64 18 66 54 76 23 96 -0.34 -0.52 nihss 233 0 0.0 18 5 17 14 21 10 28 0.48 -0.74 sbp 233 0 0.0 146 26 146 129 164 78 214 -0.07 -0.22 time.iv 233 30 12.9 98 45 85 67 110 42 218 1.03 0.08 aspects 233 0 0.0 8 2 9 7 10 5 10 -0.56 -0.98 time.rand 233 2 0.9 203 57 204 152 250 100 300 0.01 -1.16 -------------------------------------------------------- trt: Control n miss p.miss mean sd median p25 p75 min max skew kurt age 267 0 0.0 65 16 66 56 76 24 94 -0.296 -0.28 nihss 267 0 0.0 18 4 18 14 22 11 25 0.017 -1.24 sbp 267 1 0.4 145 24 145 128 161 82 231 0.156 0.08 time.iv 267 25 9.4 88 26 87 65 116 44 130 0.001 -1.32 aspects 267 4 1.5 9 1 9 8 10 5 10 -1.071 0.36 time.rand 267 0 0.0 214 70 196 149 266 120 360 0.508 -0.93 p-values pNormal pNonNormal age 0.342813660 0.57856976 nihss 0.787487252 0.45311695 sbp 0.647157646 0.51346132 time.iv 0.003073372 0.59641104 aspects 0.032662901 0.07464683 time.rand 0.050803672 0.25134327 Standardize mean differences 1 vs 2 age 0.08478764 nihss 0.02405390 sbp 0.04100833 time.iv 0.27691223 aspects 0.19210662 time.rand 0.17720957 ======================================================================================= ### Summary of categorical variables ### trt: Intervention var n miss p.miss level freq percent cum.percent sex 233 0 0.0 Female 98 42.1 42.1 Male 135 57.9 100.0 location 233 0 0.0 Left 116 49.8 49.8 Right 117 50.2 100.0 hx.isch 233 0 0.0 No 204 87.6 87.6 Yes 29 12.4 100.0 afib 233 0 0.0 0 167 71.7 71.7 1 66 28.3 100.0 dm 233 0 0.0 0 204 87.6 87.6 1 29 12.4 100.0 mrankin 233 0 0.0 0 190 81.5 81.5 1 21 9.0 90.6 2 12 5.2 95.7 &gt; 2 10 4.3 100.0 iv.altep 233 0 0.0 No 30 12.9 12.9 Yes 203 87.1 100.0 ia.occlus 233 0 0.0 Intracranial ICA 1 0.4 0.4 ICA with M1 59 25.3 25.8 M1 154 66.1 91.8 M2 18 7.7 99.6 A1 or A2 1 0.4 100.0 extra.ica 233 0 0.0 0 158 67.8 67.8 1 75 32.2 100.0 -------------------------------------------------------- trt: Control var n miss p.miss level freq percent cum.percent sex 267 0 0.0 Female 110 41.2 41.2 Male 157 58.8 100.0 location 267 0 0.0 Left 153 57.3 57.3 Right 114 42.7 100.0 hx.isch 267 0 0.0 No 242 90.6 90.6 Yes 25 9.4 100.0 afib 267 0 0.0 0 198 74.2 74.2 1 69 25.8 100.0 dm 267 0 0.0 0 233 87.3 87.3 1 34 12.7 100.0 mrankin 267 0 0.0 0 214 80.1 80.1 1 29 10.9 91.0 2 13 4.9 95.9 &gt; 2 11 4.1 100.0 iv.altep 267 0 0.0 No 25 9.4 9.4 Yes 242 90.6 100.0 ia.occlus 267 1 0.4 Intracranial ICA 3 1.1 1.1 ICA with M1 75 28.2 29.3 M1 165 62.0 91.4 M2 21 7.9 99.2 A1 or A2 2 0.8 100.0 extra.ica 267 1 0.4 0 196 73.7 73.7 1 70 26.3 100.0 p-values pApprox pExact sex 0.9171387 0.8561188 location 0.1113553 0.1056020 hx.isch 0.3352617 0.3124683 afib 0.6009691 0.5460206 dm 1.0000000 1.0000000 mrankin 0.9224798 0.9173657 iv.altep 0.2674968 0.2518374 ia.occlus 0.7945580 0.8189090 extra.ica 0.1793385 0.1667574 Standardize mean differences 1 vs 2 sex 0.017479025 location 0.151168444 hx.isch 0.099032275 afib 0.055906317 dm 0.008673478 mrankin 0.062543164 iv.altep 0.111897009 ia.occlus 0.117394890 extra.ica 0.129370206 In this case, I have simulated the data to mirror the results in the published Table 1 for this study. In no way have I captured the full range of the real data, or any of the relationships in that data, so it’s more important here to see what’s available in the analysis, rather than to interpret it closely in the clinical context. 1.7 Exporting the Completed Table 1 from R to Excel or Word Once you’ve built the table and are generally satisfied with it, you’ll probably want to be able to drop it into Excel or Word for final cleanup. 1.7.1 Approach A: Save and open in Excel One option is to save the Table 1 to a .csv file within our data subfolder (note that the data folder must already exist), which you can then open directly in Excel. This is the approach I generally use. Note the addition of some quote, noSpaces and printToggle selections here. fs.table1save &lt;- print(att2, nonnormal = c(&quot;age&quot;, &quot;nihss&quot;, &quot;time.iv&quot;, &quot;aspects&quot;, &quot;time.rand&quot;), exact = c(&quot;location&quot;, &quot;mrankin&quot;), quote = FALSE, noSpaces = TRUE, printToggle = FALSE) write.csv(fs.table1save, file = &quot;data/fs-table1.csv&quot;) When I then open the fs-table1.csv file in Excel, it looks like this: And from here, I can either drop it directly into Word, or present it as is, or start tweaking it to meet formatting needs. 1.7.2 Approach B: Produce the Table so you can cut and paste it print(att2, nonnormal = c(&quot;age&quot;, &quot;nihss&quot;, &quot;time.iv&quot;, &quot;aspects&quot;, &quot;time.rand&quot;), exact = c(&quot;location&quot;, &quot;mrankin&quot;), quote = TRUE, noSpaces = TRUE) This will look like a mess by itself, but if you: copy and paste that mess into Excel select Text to Columns from the Data menu select Delimited, then Space and select Treat consecutive delimiters as one you should get something usable again. Or, in Word, insert the text select the text with your mouse select Insert … Table … Convert Text to Table place a quotation mark in the “Other” area under Separate text at … After dropping blank columns, the result looks pretty good. 1.8 A Controlled Biological Experiment - The Blood-Brain Barrier My source for the data and the following explanatory paragraph is page 307 from F. L. Ramsey and Schafer (2002). The original data come from Barnett et al. (1995). The human brain (and that of rats, coincidentally) is protected from the bacteria and toxins that course through the bloodstream by something called the blood-brain barrier. After a method of disrupting the barrier was developed, researchers tested this new mechanism, as follows. A series of 34 rats were inoculated with human lung cancer cells to induce brain tumors. After 9-11 days they were infused with either the barrier disruption (BD) solution or, as a control, a normal saline (NS) solution. Fifteen minutes later, the rats received a standard dose of a particular therapeutic antibody (L6-F(ab’)2. The key measure of the effectiveness of transmission across the brain-blood barrier is the ratio of the antibody concentration in the brain tumor to the antibody concentration in normal tissue outside the brain. The rats were then sacrificed, and the amounts of antibody in the brain tumor and in normal tissue from the liver were measured. The study’s primary objective is to determine whether the antibody concentration in the tumor increased when the blood-barrier disruption infusion was given, and if so, by how much? 1.9 The bloodbrain.csv file Consider the data, available on the Data and Code page of our course website in the bloodbrain.csv file, which includes the following variables: Variable Description case identification number for the rat (1 - 34) brain an outcome: Brain tumor antibody count (per gram) liver an outcome: Liver antibody count (per gram) tlratio an outcome: tumor / liver concentration ratio solution the treatment: BD (barrier disruption) or NS (normal saline) sactime a design variable: Sacrifice time (hours; either 0.5, 3, 24 or 72) postin covariate: Days post-inoculation of lung cancer cells (9, 10 or 11) sex covariate: M or F wt.init covariate: Initial weight (grams) wt.loss covariate: Weight loss (grams) wt.tumor covariate: Tumor weight (10-4 grams) And here’s what the data look like in R. bloodbrain # A tibble: 34 x 11 case brain liver tlratio solution sactime postin sex wt.init &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;int&gt; 1 1 41081 1456164 0.0282 BD 0.500 10 F 239 2 2 44286 1602171 0.0276 BD 0.500 10 F 225 3 3 102926 1601936 0.0642 BD 0.500 10 F 224 4 4 25927 1776411 0.0146 BD 0.500 10 F 184 5 5 42643 1351184 0.0316 BD 0.500 10 F 250 6 6 31342 1790863 0.0175 NS 0.500 10 F 196 7 7 22815 1633386 0.0140 NS 0.500 10 F 200 8 8 16629 1618757 0.0103 NS 0.500 10 F 273 9 9 22315 1567602 0.0142 NS 0.500 10 F 216 10 10 77961 1060057 0.0735 BD 3.00 10 F 267 # ... with 24 more rows, and 2 more variables: wt.loss &lt;dbl&gt;, # wt.tumor &lt;int&gt; 1.10 A Table 1 for bloodbrain Barnett et al. (1995) did not provide a Table 1 for these data, so let’s build one to compare the two solutions (BD vs. NS) on the covariates and outcomes, plus the natural logarithm of the tumor/liver concentration ratio (tlratio). We’ll opt to treat the sacrifice time (sactime) and the days post-inoculation of lung cancer cells (postin) as categorical rather than quantitative variables. bloodbrain &lt;- bloodbrain %&gt;% mutate(logTL = log(tlratio)) dput(names(bloodbrain)) c(&quot;case&quot;, &quot;brain&quot;, &quot;liver&quot;, &quot;tlratio&quot;, &quot;solution&quot;, &quot;sactime&quot;, &quot;postin&quot;, &quot;sex&quot;, &quot;wt.init&quot;, &quot;wt.loss&quot;, &quot;wt.tumor&quot;, &quot;logTL&quot;) OK - there’s the list of variables we’ll need.

In this work, we will focus on data from the 2016 SMART, and in particular on data from the Cleveland-Elyria, OH, Metropolitan Statistical Area. The purpose of this survey is to provide localized health information that can help public health practitioners identify local emerging health problems, plan and evaluate local responses, and efficiently allocate resources to specific needs. 2.1.1 Key resources the full data are available in the form of the 2016 SMART BRFSS MMSA Data, found in a zipped SAS Transport Format file. The data were released in August 2017. the MMSA Variable Layout PDF which simply lists the variables included in the data file the Calculated Variables PDF which describes the risk factors by data variable names - there is also an online summary matrix of these calculated variables, as well. the lengthy 2016 Survey Questions PDF which lists all questions asked as part of the BRFSS in 2016 the enormous Codebook for the 2016 BRFSS Survey PDF which identifies the variables by name for us. Later this term, we’ll use all of those resources to help construct a more complete data set than we’ll study today. I’ll also demonstrate how I built the smartcle1 data set that we’ll use in this Chapter. 2.2 The smartcle1 data: Cookbook The smartcle1.csv data file available on the Data and Code page of our website describes information on 11 variables for 1036 respondents to the BRFSS 2016, who live in the Cleveland-Elyria, OH, Metropolitan Statistical Area.

We’ll start with an effort to predict physhealth using bmi. A natural graph would be a scatterplot. ggplot(data = smartcle2, aes(x = bmi, y = physhealth)) + geom_point() A good question to ask ourselves here might be: “In what BMI range can we make a reasonable prediction of physhealth?” Now, we might take the plot above and add a simple linear model … ggplot(data = smartcle2, aes(x = bmi, y = physhealth)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, se = FALSE) which shows the same least squares regression model that we can fit with the lm command. 2.6.1 Fitting a Simple Regression Model model_A &lt;- lm(physhealth ~ bmi, data = smartcle2) model_A Call: lm(formula = physhealth ~ bmi, data = smartcle2) Coefficients: (Intercept) bmi -1.4514 0.1953 summary(model_A) Call: lm(formula = physhealth ~ bmi, data = smartcle2) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -9.171 -4.057 -3.193 -1.576 28.073 Coefficients: Estimate Std.

Each of the 896 respondents included in the smartcle2 data makes a contribution to this model. 2.6.2.1 Residuals Suppose Harry is one of the people in that group, and Harry’s data is bmi = 20, and physhealth = 3. Harry’s observed value of physhealth is just the value we have in the data for them, in this case, observed physhealth = 3 for Harry. Harry’s fitted or predicted physhealth value is the result of calculating -1.45 + 0.195*bmi for Harry. So, if Harry’s BMI was 20, then Harry’s predicted physhealth value is -1.45 + (0.195)(20) = 2.45. The residual for Harry is then his observed outcome minus his fitted outcome, so Harry has a residual of 3 - 2.45 = 0.55. Graphically, a residual represents vertical distance between the observed point and the fitted regression line. Points above the regression line will have positive residuals, and points below the regression line will have negative residuals. Points on the line have zero residuals. The residuals are summarized at the top of the summary output for linear model. The mean residual will always be zero in an ordinary least squares model, but a five number summary of the residuals is provided by the summary, as is an estimated standard deviation of the residuals (called here the Residual standard error.) In the smartcle2 data, the minimum residual was -9.17, so for one subject, the observed value was 9.17 days smaller than the predicted value. This means that the prediction was 9.17 days too large for that subject. Similarly, the maximum residual was 28.07 days, so for one subject the prediction was 28.07 days too small. Not a strong performance. In a least squares model, the residuals are assumed to follow a Normal distribution, with mean zero, and standard deviation (for the smartcle2 data) of about 8.6 days. Thus, by the definition of a Normal distribution, we’d expect about 68% of the residuals to be between -8.6 and +8.6 days, about 95% of the residuals to be between -17.2 and +17.2 days, about all (99.7%) of the residuals to be between -25.8 and +25.8 days. 2.6.2.2 Coefficients section The summary for a linear model shows Estimates, Standard Errors, t values and p values for each coefficient fit. The Estimates are the point estimates of the intercept and slope of bmi in our model. In this case, our estimated slope is 0.195, which implies that if Harry’s BMI is 20 and Sally’s BMI is 21, we predict that Sally’s physhealth will be 0.195 days larger than Harry’s. The Standard Errors are also provided for each estimate. We can create rough 95% confidence intervals by adding and subtracting two standard errors from each coefficient, or we can get a slightly more accurate answer with the confint function. Here, the 95% confidence interval for the slope of bmi is estimated to be (0.11, 0.28). This is a good measure of the uncertainty in the slope that is captured by our model. We are 95% confident in the process of building this interval, but this doesn’t mean we’re 95% sure that the true slope is actually in that interval. Also available are a t value (just the Estimate divided by the Standard Error) and the appropriate p value for testing the null hypothesis that the true value of the coefficient is 0 against a two-tailed alternative. If a slope coefficient is statistically significantly different from 0, this implies that 0 will not be part of the uncertainty interval obtained through confint. If the slope was zero, it would suggest that bmi would add no predictive value to the model. But that’s unlikely here. If the bmi slope coefficient is associated with a small p value, as in the case of our model_A, it suggests that the model including bmi is statistically significantly better at predicting physhealth than the model without bmi. Without bmi our model_A would become an intercept-only model, in this case, which would predict the mean physhealth for everyone, regardless of any other information. 2.6.2.3 Model Fit Summaries The summary of a linear model also displays: The residual standard error and associated degrees of freedom for the residuals. For a simple (one-predictor) least regression like this, the residual degrees of freedom will be the sample size minus 2. The multiple R-squared (or coefficient of determination) This is interpreted as the proportion of variation in the outcome (physhealth) accounted for by the model, and will always fall between 0 and 1 as a result. Our model_A accounts for a mere 2% of the variation in physhealth. The Adjusted R-squared value “adjusts” for the size of our model in terms of the number of coefficients included in the model. The adjusted R-squared will always be less than the Multiple R-squared. We still hope to find models with relatively large adjusted R2 values. In particular, we hope to find models where the adjusted R2 isn’t substantially less than the Multiple R-squared. The adjusted R-squared is usually a better estimate of likely performance of our model in new data than is the Multiple R-squared. The adjusted R-squared result is no longer interpretable as a proportion of anything - in fact, it can fall below 0. We can obtain the adjusted R2 from the raw R2, the number of observations N and the number of predictors p included in the model, as follows: \\[ R^2_{adj} = 1 - \\frac{(1 - R^2)(N - 1)}{N - p - 1}, \\] The F statistic and p value from a global ANOVA test of the model. Obtaining a statistically significant result here is usually pretty straightforward, since the comparison is between our model, and a model which simply predicts the mean value of the outcome for everyone. In a simple (one-predictor) linear regression like this, the t statistic for the slope is just the square root of the F statistic, and the resulting p values for the slope’s t test and for the global F test will be identical. To see the complete ANOVA F test for this model, we can run anova(model_A). anova(model_A) Analysis of Variance Table Response: physhealth Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) bmi 1 1366 1365.5 18.655 1.742e-05 *** Residuals 894 65441 73.2 --- Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 2.6.3 Using the broom package The broom package has three functions of particular use in a linear regression model: 2.6.3.1 The tidy function tidy builds a data frame/tibble containing information about the coefficients in the model, their standard errors, t statistics and p values. tidy(model_A) term estimate std.error statistic p.value 1 (Intercept) -1.4514298 1.29185199 -1.123526 2.615156e-01 2 bmi 0.1952739 0.04521145 4.319125 1.741859e-05 2.6.3.2 The glance function glance` builds a data frame/tibble containing summary statistics about the model, including the (raw) multiple R2 and adjusted R^2 sigma which is the residual standard error the F statistic, p.value model df and df.residual associated with the global ANOVA test, plus several statistics that will be useful in comparing models down the line: the model’s log likelihood function value, logLik the model’s Akaike’s Information Criterion value, AIC the model’s Bayesian Information Criterion value, BIC and the model’s deviance statistic glance(model_A) r.squared adj.r.squared sigma statistic p.value df logLik 1 0.02044019 0.01934449 8.555737 18.65484 1.741859e-05 2 -3193.723 AIC BIC deviance df.residual 1 6393.446 6407.84 65441.36 894 2.6.3.3 The augment function augment builds a data frame/tibble which adds fitted values, residuals and other diagnostic summaries that describe each observation to the original data used to fit the model, and this includes .fitted and .resid, the fitted and residual values, in addition to .hat, the leverage value for this observation .cooksd, the Cook’s distance measure of influence for this observation .stdresid, the standardized residual (think of this as a z-score - a measure of the residual divided by its associated standard deviation .sigma) and se.fit which will help us generate prediction intervals for the model downstream Note that each of the new columns begins with . to avoid overwriting any data. head(augment(model_A)) physhealth bmi .fitted .se.fit .resid .hat .sigma 1 0 26.69 3.760430 0.2907252 -3.76043009 0.001154651 8.559600 2 0 23.70 3.176561 0.3422908 -3.17656119 0.001600574 8.559865 3 1 26.92 3.805343 0.2890054 -2.80534308 0.001141030 8.560010 4 0 21.66 2.778202 0.4005101 -2.77820248 0.002191352 8.560020 5 5 24.09 3.252718 0.3329154 1.74728200 0.001514095 8.560326 6 4 27.64 3.945940 0.2860087 0.05405972 0.001117490 8.560526 .cooksd .std.resid 1 1.117852e-04 -0.439775451 2 1.106717e-04 -0.371575999 3 6.147744e-05 -0.328077528 4 1.160381e-04 -0.325074461 5 3.167016e-05 0.204378225 6 2.235722e-08 0.006322069 For more on the broom package, you may want to look at this vignette. 2.6.4 How does the model do? (Residuals vs. Fitted Values) Remember that the R2 value was about 2%. plot(model_A, which = 1) This is a plot of residuals vs. fitted values. The goal here is for this plot to look like a random scatter of points, perhaps like a “fuzzy football”, and that’s not what we have. Why? If you prefer, here’s a ggplot2 version of a similar plot, now looking at standardized residuals instead of raw residuals, and adding a loess smooth and a linear fit to the result. ggplot(augment(model_A), aes(x = .fitted, y = .std.resid)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, se = FALSE, col = &quot;red&quot;, linetype = &quot;dashed&quot;) + geom_smooth(method = &quot;loess&quot;, se = FALSE, col = &quot;navy&quot;) + theme_bw() The problem we’re having here becomes, I think, a little more obvious if we look at what we’re predicting. Does physhealth look like a good candidate for a linear model? ggplot(smartcle2, aes(x = physhealth)) + geom_histogram(bins = 30, fill = &quot;dodgerblue&quot;, color = &quot;royalblue&quot;) smartcle2 %&gt;% count(physhealth == 0, physhealth == 30) # A tibble: 3 x 3 `physhealth == 0` `physhealth == 30` n &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;int&gt; 1 FALSE FALSE 231 2 FALSE TRUE 74 3 TRUE FALSE 591 No matter what model we fit, if we are predicting physhealth, and most of the data are values of 0 and 30, we have limited variation in our outcome, and so our linear model will be somewhat questionable just on that basis. A normal Q-Q plot of the standardized residuals for our model_A shows this problem, too. plot(model_A, which = 2) We’re going to need a method to deal with this sort of outcome, that has both a floor and a ceiling. We’ll get there eventually, but linear regression alone doesn’t look promising. All right, so that didn’t go anywhere great. Let’s try again, with a new outcome. 2.7 A New Small Study: Predicting BMI We’ll begin by investigating the problem of predicting bmi, at first with just three regression inputs: sex, exerany and sleephrs, in our new smartcle2 data set. The outcome of interest is bmi. Inputs to the regression model are: female = 1 if the subject is female, and 0 if they are male exerany = 1 if the subject exercised in the past 30 days, and 0 if they didn’t sleephrs = hours slept in a typical 24-hour period (treated as quantitative) 2.7.1 Does female predict bmi well? 2.7.1.1 Graphical Assessment ggplot(smartcle2, aes(x = female, y = bmi)) + geom_point() Not so helpful. We should probably specify that female is a factor, and try another plotting approach. ggplot(smartcle2, aes(x = factor(female), y = bmi)) + geom_boxplot() The median BMI looks a little higher for males. Let’s see if a model reflects that. 2.8 c2_m1: A simple t-test model c2_m1 &lt;- lm(bmi ~ female, data = smartcle2) c2_m1 Call: lm(formula = bmi ~ female, data = smartcle2) Coefficients: (Intercept) female 28.3600 -0.8457 summary(c2_m1) Call: lm(formula = bmi ~ female, data = smartcle2) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -15.650 -4.129 -1.080 2.727 38.546 Coefficients: Estimate Std.

Note that this simple regression model just gives us the t-test. t.test(bmi ~ female, var.equal = TRUE, data = smartcle2) Two Sample t-test data: bmi by female t = 1.9752, df = 894, p-value = 0.04855 alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 95 percent confidence interval: 0.00539878 1.68605160 sample estimates: mean in group 0 mean in group 1 28.36000 27.51427 2.9 c2_m2: Adding another predictor (two-way ANOVA without interaction) When we add in the information about exerany to our original model, we might first picture the data. We could look at separate histograms, ggplot(smartcle2, aes(x = bmi)) + geom_histogram(bins = 30) + facet_grid(female ~ exerany, labeller = label_both) or maybe boxplots? ggplot(smartcle2, aes(x = factor(female), y = bmi)) + geom_boxplot() + facet_wrap(~ exerany, labeller = label_both) ggplot(smartcle2, aes(x = female, y = bmi))+ geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.2) + theme_bw() + facet_wrap(~ exerany, labeller = label_both) OK. Let’s try fitting a model. c2_m2 &lt;- lm(bmi ~ female + exerany, data = smartcle2) c2_m2 Call: lm(formula = bmi ~ female + exerany, data = smartcle2) Coefficients: (Intercept) female exerany 30.334 -1.095 -2.384 This new model predicts only four predicted values: bmi = 30.334 if the subject is male and did not exercise (so female = 0 and exerany = 0) bmi = 30.334 - 1.095 = 29.239 if the subject is female and did not exercise (female = 1 and exerany = 0) bmi = 30.334 - 2.384 = 27.950 if the subject is male and exercised (so female = 0 and exerany = 1), and, finally bmi = 30.334 - 1.095 - 2.384 = 26.855 if the subject is female and exercised (so both female and exerany = 1). For those who did not exercise, the model is: bmi = 30.334 - 1.095 female and for those who did exercise, the model is: bmi = 27.95 - 1.095 female Only the intercept of the bmi-female model changes depending on exerany. summary(c2_m2) Call: lm(formula = bmi ~ female + exerany, data = smartcle2) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -15.240 -4.091 -1.095 2.602 36.822 Coefficients: Estimate Std.

The R2 value suggests that just under 3% of the variation in bmi is accounted for by this ANOVA model. In fact, this regression (on two binary indicator variables) is simply a two-way ANOVA model without an interaction term. anova(c2_m2) Analysis of Variance Table Response: bmi Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) female 1 156 155.61 3.9977 0.04586 * exerany 1 897 896.93 23.0435 1.856e-06 *** Residuals 893 34759 38.92 --- Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 2.10 c2_m3: Adding the interaction term (Two-way ANOVA with interaction) Suppose we want to let the effect of female vary depending on the exerany status.

Since the c2_m4 model contains the c2_m1 model’s predictors as a subset and the outcome is the same for each model, we consider the models nested and have some extra tools available to compare them. I might start by looking at the basic summaries for each model. glance(c2_m4) r.squared adj.r.squared sigma statistic p.value df logLik 1 0.008341404 0.005006229 6.309685 2.50104 0.05818038 4 -2919.873 AIC BIC deviance df.residual 1 5849.747 5873.736 35512.42 892 glance(c2_m1) r.squared adj.r.squared sigma statistic p.value df logLik 1 0.004345169 0.003231461 6.31531 3.901534 0.04854928 2 -2921.675 AIC BIC deviance df.residual 1 5849.35 5863.744 35655.53 894 The R2 is twice as large for the model with sleephrs, but still very tiny. The p value for the global ANOVA test is actually less significant in c2_m4 than in c2_m1. Smaller AIC and smaller BIC statistics are more desirable. Here, there’s little to choose from, but c2_m1 is a little better on each standard. We might also consider a significance test by looking at an ANOVA model comparison. This is only appropriate because c2_m1 is nested in c2_m4. anova(c2_m4, c2_m1) Analysis of Variance Table Model 1: bmi ~ female * sleephrs Model 2: bmi ~ female Res.Df RSS Df Sum of Sq F Pr(&gt;F) 1 892 35512 2 894 35656 -2 -143.11 1.7973 0.1663 The addition of the sleephrs term picked up 143 in the sum of squares column, at a cost of two degrees of freedom, yielding a p value of 0.166, suggesting that this isn’t a significant improvement over the model that just did a t-test on female. 2.12 Making Predictions with a Linear Regression Model Recall model 4, which yields predictions for body mass index on the basis of the main effects of sex (female) and hours of sleep (sleephrs) and their interaction. c2_m4 Call: lm(formula = bmi ~ female * sleephrs, data = smartcle2) Coefficients: (Intercept) female sleephrs female:sleephrs 27.2661 2.5263 0.1569 -0.4797 2.12.1 Fitting an Individual Prediction and 95% Prediction Interval What do we predict for the bmi of a subject who is female and gets 8 hours of sleep per night? c2_new1 &lt;- data_frame(female = 1, sleephrs = 8) predict(c2_m4, newdata = c2_new1, interval = &quot;prediction&quot;, level = 0.95) fit lwr upr 1 27.21065 14.8107 39.6106 The predicted bmi for this new subject is 27.61. The prediction interval shows the bounds of a 95% uncertainty interval for a predicted bmi for an individual female subject who gets 8 hours of sleep on average per evening. From the predict function applied to a linear model, we can get the prediction intervals for any new data points in this manner. 2.12.2 Confidence Interval for an Average Prediction What do we predict for the average body mass index of a population of subjects who are female and sleep for 8 hours? predict(c2_m4, newdata = c2_new1, interval = &quot;confidence&quot;, level = 0.95) fit lwr upr 1 27.21065 26.57328 27.84801 How does this result compare to the prediction interval? 2.12.3 Fitting Multiple Individual Predictions to New Data How does our prediction change for a respondent if they instead get 7, or 9 hours of sleep?

A one category change in female or a one hour change in sleephrs? 2.12.4 Simulation to represent predictive uncertainty in Model 4 Suppose we want to predict the bmi of a female subject who sleeps for eight hours per night. As we have seen, we can do this automatically for a linear model like this one, using the predict function applied to the linear model, but a simulation prediction can also be done.

If we center the quantitative input sleephrs before building the model, we get a more interpretable interaction term. smartcle2_c &lt;- smartcle2 %&gt;% mutate(sleephrs_c = sleephrs - mean(sleephrs)) c2_m4_c &lt;- lm(bmi ~ female * sleephrs_c, data = smartcle2_c) summary(c2_m4_c) Call: lm(formula = bmi ~ female * sleephrs_c, data = smartcle2_c) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -15.498 -4.179 -1.035 2.830 38.204 Coefficients: Estimate Std.

Our original model was bmi = 27.26 + 2.53 female + 0.16 sleephrs - 0.48 female x sleephrs Our new model is bmi = 28.37 - 0.84 female + 0.16 centered sleephrs - 0.48 female x centered sleephrs. So our new model on centered data is: 28.37 + 0.16 centered sleephrs_c for male subjects, and (28.37 - 0.84) + (0.16 - 0.48) centered sleephrs_c, or 27.53 - 0.32 centered sleephrs_c for female subjects. In our new (centered sleephrs_c) model, the main effect of female now corresponds to a predictive difference (female - male) in bmi with sleephrs at its mean value, 7.02 hours, the intercept term is now the predicted bmi for a male respondent who sleeps an average number of hours, and the product term corresponds to the change in the slope of centered sleephrs_c on bmi for a female rather than a male subject, while the residual standard deviation and the R-squared values remain unchanged from the model before centering. 2.13.1 Plot of Model 4 on Centered sleephrs: c2_m4_c ggplot(smartcle2_c, aes(x = sleephrs_c, y = bmi, group = female, col = factor(female))) + geom_point(alpha = 0.5, size = 2) + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, se = FALSE) + guides(color = FALSE) + labs(x = &quot;Sleep Hours, centered&quot;, y = &quot;Body Mass Index&quot;, title = &quot;Model `c2_m4` on centered data&quot;) + facet_wrap(~ female, labeller = label_both) 2.14 Rescaling an input by subtracting the mean and dividing by 2 standard deviations Centering helped us interpret the main effects in the regression, but it still leaves a scaling problem. The female coefficient estimate is much larger than that of sleephrs, but this is misleading, considering that we are comparing the complete change in one variable (sex = female or not) to a 1-hour change in average sleep. Gelman and Hill (2007) recommend all continuous predictors be scaled by dividing by 2 standard deviations, so that: a 1-unit change in the rescaled predictor corresponds to a change from 1 standard deviation below the mean, to 1 standard deviation above. an unscaled binary (1/0) predictor with 50% probability of occurring will be exactly comparable to a rescaled continuous predictor done in this way. smartcle2_rescale &lt;- smartcle2 %&gt;% mutate(sleephrs_z = (sleephrs - mean(sleephrs))/(2*sd(sleephrs))) 2.14.1 Refitting model c2_m4 to the rescaled data c2_m4_z &lt;- lm(bmi ~ female * sleephrs_z, data = smartcle2_rescale) summary(c2_m4_z) Call: lm(formula = bmi ~ female * sleephrs_z, data = smartcle2_rescale) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -15.498 -4.179 -1.035 2.830 38.204 Coefficients: Estimate Std.

Our original model was bmi = 27.26 + 2.53 female + 0.16 sleephrs - 0.48 female x sleephrs Our model on centered sleephrs was bmi = 28.37 - 0.84 female + 0.16 centered sleephrs_c - 0.48 female x centered sleephrs_c. Our new model on rescaled sleephrs is bmi = 28.37 - 0.84 female + 0.46 rescaled sleephrs_z - 1.42 female x rescaled sleephrs_z. So our rescaled model is: 28.37 + 0.46 rescaled sleephrs_z for male subjects, and (28.37 - 0.84) + (0.46 - 1.42) rescaled sleephrs_z, or 27.53 - 0.96 rescaled sleephrs_z for female subjects. In this new rescaled (sleephrs_z) model, then, the main effect of female, -0.84, still corresponds to a predictive difference (female - male) in bmi with sleephrs at its mean value, 7.02 hours, the intercept term is still the predicted bmi for a male respondent who sleeps an average number of hours, and the residual standard deviation and the R-squared values remain unchanged, as before, but now we also have that: the coefficient of sleephrs_z indicates the predictive difference in bmi associated with a change in sleephrs of 2 standard deviations (from one standard deviation below the mean of 7.02 to one standard deviation above 7.02.) Since the standard deviation of sleephrs is 1.48, this corresponds to a change from 5.54 hours per night to 8.50 hours per night. the coefficient of the product term (-1.42) corresponds to the change in the coefficient of sleephrs_z for females as compared to males. 2.14.3 Plot of model on rescaled data ggplot(smartcle2_rescale, aes(x = sleephrs_z, y = bmi, group = female, col = factor(female))) + geom_point(alpha = 0.5) + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, size = 1.5) + scale_color_discrete(name = &quot;Is subject female?&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;Sleep Hours, standardized (2 sd)&quot;, y = &quot;Body Mass Index&quot;, title = &quot;Model `c2_m4_z` on rescaled data&quot;) 2.15 c2_m5: What if we add more variables?

The outcome should accurately reflect the phenomenon of interest. The model should include all relevant predictors. (It can be difficult to decide which predictors are necessary, and what to do with predictors that have large standard errors.) The model should generalize to all of the cases to which it will be applied. Can the available data answer our question reliably? Additivity and linearity - most important assumption of a regression model is that its deterministic component is a linear function of the predictors. We often think about transformations in this setting. Independence of errors - errors from the prediction line are independent of each other Equal variance of errors - if this is violated, we can more efficiently estimate parameters using weighted least squares approaches, where each point is weighted inversely proportional to its variance, but this doesn’t affect the coefficients much, if at all. Normality of errors - not generally important for estimating the regression line 2.18.1 Checking Assumptions in model c2_m7 How does the assumption of linearity behind this model look? plot(c2_m7, which = 1) We see no strong signs of serious non-linearity here. There’s no obvious curve in the plot, for example. What can we conclude from the plot below? plot(c2_m7, which = 5) This plot can help us identify points with large standardized residuals, large leverage values, and large influence on the model (as indicated by large values of Cook’s distance.) In this case, I see no signs of any points used in the model with especially large influence, although there are some poorly fitted points (with especially large standardized residuals.)

We’ll start by building up a data set with the summaries we want to plot. bond.sum &lt;- bonding %&gt;% group_by(resin, light) %&gt;% summarize(mean.str = mean(strength), sd.str = sd(strength)) bond.sum # A tibble: 8 x 4 # Groups: resin [?] resin light mean.str sd.str &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 A Halogen 17.8 4.02 2 A LED 19.1 5.63 3 B Halogen 19.9 5.62 4 B LED 24.6 7.25 5 C Halogen 22.5 6.19 6 C LED 27.8 5.56 7 D Halogen 40.3 4.15 8 D LED 23.8 5.70 Now, we’ll use this new data set to plot the means and standard deviations of strength at each combination of resin and light. ## The error bars will overlap unless we adjust the position. pd &lt;- position_dodge(0.2) # move them .1 to the left and right ggplot(bond.sum, aes(x = resin, y = mean.str, col = light)) + geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = mean.str - sd.str, ymax = mean.str + sd.str), width = 0.2, position = pd) + geom_point(size = 2, position = pd) + geom_line(aes(group = light), position = pd) + scale_color_manual(values = c(&quot;purple&quot;, &quot;darkorange&quot;)) + theme_bw() + labs(y = &quot;Bonding Strength (MPa)&quot;, x = &quot;Resin Type&quot;, title = &quot;Observed Means (+/- SD) of Bonding Strength&quot;) Is there evidence of a meaningful interaction between the resin type and the light source on the bonding strength in this plot? Sure. A meaningful interaction just means that the strength associated with different resin types depends on the light source. With LED light, it appears that resin C leads to the strongest bonding strength. With Halogen light, though, it seems that resin D is substantially stronger. Note that the lines we see here connecting the light sources aren’t in parallel (as they would be if we had zero interaction between resin and light), but rather, they cross. 3.4.1 Skimming the data after grouping by resin and light We might want to look at a numerical summary of the strengths within these groups, too. bonding %&gt;% group_by(resin, light) %&gt;% skim(strength) Skim summary statistics n obs: 80 n variables: 4 group variables: resin, light Variable type: numeric resin light variable missing complete n mean sd p0 p25 median A Halogen strength 0 10 10 17.77 4.02 9.3 15.75 18.35 A LED strength 0 10 10 19.06 5.63 11.6 16.18 17.8 B Halogen strength 0 10 10 19.9 5.62 11.8 14.78 21.75 B LED strength 0 10 10 24.56 7.25 12.8 20.45 24.45 C Halogen strength 0 10 10 22.54 6.19 14.5 18.85 21.3 C LED strength 0 10 10 27.77 5.56 16.5 24.7 28.45 D Halogen strength 0 10 10 40.3 4.15 35.5 36.55 40.4 D LED strength 0 10 10 23.85 5.7 17.3 19.75 21.45 p75 p100 20 23.5 22.5 28 24.12 27.1 27.87 35.2 25.8 33 31.83 34.5 43.62 47.2 28.2 35.1 3.5 Fitting the Two-Way ANOVA model with Interaction c3_m1 &lt;- lm(strength ~ resin * light, data = bonding) summary(c3_m1) Call: lm(formula = strength ~ resin * light, data = bonding) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -11.760 -3.663 -0.320 3.697 11.250 Coefficients: Estimate Std.

If it’s important, then our best model is the model including the interaction. If it’s not important, we will often move on to consider a new model, fit without an interaction. The ANOVA table is especially helpful in this case, because it lets us look specifically at the interaction effect. anova(c3_m1) Analysis of Variance Table Response: strength Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) resin 3 1999.72 666.57 21.2499 5.792e-10 *** light 1 34.72 34.72 1.1067 0.2963 resin:light 3 1571.96 523.99 16.7043 2.457e-08 *** Residuals 72 2258.52 31.37 --- Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 3.5.2 Is the interaction important? In this case, the interaction: is evident in the means plot, and is highly statistically significant, and accounts for a sizeable fraction (27%) of the overall variation \\[ \\eta^2_{interaction} = \\frac{\\mbox{SS(resin:light)}}{SS(Total)} = \\frac{1571.96}{1999.72 + 34.72 + 1571.96 + 2258.52} = 0.268 \\] If the interaction were either large or significant we would be inclined to keep it in the model. In this case, it’s both, so there’s no real reason to remove it. 3.5.3 Interpreting the Interaction Recall the model equation, which is: c3_m1 Call: lm(formula = strength ~ resin * light, data = bonding) Coefficients: (Intercept) resinB resinC resinD 17.77 2.13 4.77 22.53 lightLED resinB:lightLED resinC:lightLED resinD:lightLED 1.29 3.37 3.94 -17.74 so we have: \\[ strength = 17.77 + 2.13 resinB + 4.77 resinC + 22.53 resinD \\\\ + 1.29 lightLED + 3.37 resinB*lightLED \\\\ + 3.94 resinC*lightLED - 17.74 resinD*lightLED \\] So, if light = Halogen, our equation is: \\[ strength = 17.77 + 2.13 resinB + 4.77 resinC + 22.53 resinD \\] And if light = LED, our equation is: \\[ strength = 19.06 + 5.50 resinB + 8.71 resinC + 4.79 resinD \\] Note that both the intercept and the slopes change as a result of the interaction. The model yields a different prediction for every possible combination of a resin type and a light source. 3.6 Comparing Individual Combinations of resin and light To make comparisons between individual combinations of a resin type and a light source, using something like Tukey’s HSD approach for multiple comparisons, we first refit the model using the aov structure, rather than lm. c3m1_aov &lt;- aov(strength ~ resin * light, data = bonding) summary(c3m1_aov) Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) resin 3 1999.7 666.6 21.250 5.79e-10 *** light 1 34.7 34.7 1.107 0.296 resin:light 3 1572.0 524.0 16.704 2.46e-08 *** Residuals 72 2258.5 31.4 --- Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 And now, we can obtain Tukey HSD comparisons (which will maintain an overall 95% family-wise confidence level) across the resin types, the light sources, and the combinations, with the TukeyHSD command. This approach is only completely appropriate if these comparisons are pre-planned, and if the design is balanced (as this is, with the same sample size for each combination of a light source and resin type.)

The subjects were randomly assigned to one of three intervention groups (usual care, low dose, and high dose.) The “low dose” subjects received a one-week intervention with a follow-up at week 5. The “high dose” subjects received a more intensive three-week intervention, with follow up at week 5. Since cortisol levels rise and fall with circadian rhythms, the cortisol measurements were taken just after rising for all subjects. These measurements were taken at baseline, and again at five weeks. The difference (baseline - week 5) in cortisol level (in micrograms / l) serves as the primary outcome. 3.8.1 Codebook and Raw Data for cortisol The data are gathered in the cortisol data set.

And how should we deal with the one missing age value (in a male patient)? 4.4 Adding a quantitative covariate, age, to the model We could fit an ANOVA model to predict st_delta using sex and age directly, but only if we categorized age into two or more groups. Because age is not categorical, we cannot include it in an ANOVA. But if age is an influence, and we don’t adjust for it, it may well bias the outcome of our initial ANOVA. With a quantitative variable like age, we will need a method called ANCOVA, for analysis of covariance. 4.4.1 The ANCOVA model ANCOVA in this case is just an ANOVA model with our outcome (st_delta) adjusted for a continuous covariate, called age. For the moment, we’ll ignore the one subject with missing age and simply fit the regression model with sex and age. summary(lm(st_delta ~ sex + age, data = emphysema)) Call: lm(formula = st_delta ~ sex + age, data = emphysema) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -8.3352 -0.4789 0.6948 1.5580 3.5202 Coefficients: Estimate Std.

Note that the model yields st_delta = -6.9 + 3.52 (sex = male) + 0.056 age, or st_delta = -6.9 + 0.056 age for female patients, and st_delta = (-6.9 + 3.52) + 0.056 age = -3.38 + 0.056 age for male patients. Note that we can test this assumption of equal slopes by fitting an alternative model (with a product term between sex and age) that doesn’t require the assumption, and we’ll do that later. 4.4.2 The ANCOVA Table First, though, we’ll look at the ANCOVA table. anova(lm(st_delta ~ sex + age, data = emphysema)) Analysis of Variance Table Response: st_delta Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) sex 1 49.284 49.284 4.6507 0.05203 . age 1 2.209 2.209 0.2085 0.65612 Residuals 12 127.164 10.597 --- Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 When we tested sex without accounting for age, we found a p value of 0.032, which is less than our usual cutpoint of 0.05. But when we adjusted for age, we find that sex loses significance, even though age is not a significant influence on st_delta by itself, according to the ANCOVA table. 4.5 Rerunning the ANCOVA model after simple imputation We could have imputed the missing age value for patient 5, rather than just deleting that patient. Suppose we do the simplest potentially reasonable thing to do: insert the mean age in where the NA value currently exists. emph_imp &lt;- replace_na(emphysema, list(age = mean(emphysema$age, na.rm = TRUE))) emph_imp # A tibble: 16 x 7 patient age sex st_base st_day5 st_day10 st_delta &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 61.0 F 14.1 2.30 10.3 -11.8 2 2 70.0 F 7.20 5.40 7.30 -1.80 3 3 65.0 M 14.2 11.9 11.3 -2.30 4 4 65.0 M 10.3 10.7 13.8 0.400 5 5 65.2 M 9.90 10.7 11.7 0.800 6 6 76.0 M 5.20 6.80 4.20 1.60 7 7 72.0 M 10.4 14.6 14.1 4.20 8 8 69.0 F 10.5 7.20 5.40 -3.30 9 9 66.0 M 5.00 5.00 5.10 0. 10 10 62.0 M 8.60 8.10 7.40 -0.500 11 11 65.0 F 16.6 14.9 13.0 -1.70 12 12 71.0 M 16.4 18.6 17.1 2.20 13 13 51.0 F 12.2 11.0 12.3 -1.20 14 14 71.0 M 6.60 3.70 4.50 -2.90 15 15 64.0 F 15.4 15.2 13.6 -0.200 16 16 50.0 M 10.2 10.8 11.2 0.600 More on simple imputation and missing data is coming soon.

Our complete case analysis (which omitted patient 5) gives us a different result than the ANCOVA based on the data after mean imputation. 4.6 Looking at a factor-covariate interaction Let’s run a model including the interaction (product) term between age and sex, which implies that the slope of age on our outcome (st_delta) depends on the patient’s sex. We’ll use the imputed data again. Here is the new ANCOVA table, which suggests that the interaction of age and sex is small (because it accounts for only a small amount of the total Sum of Squares) and not significant (p = 0.91). anova(lm(st_delta ~ sex * age, data = emph_imp)) Analysis of Variance Table Response: st_delta Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) sex 1 52.547 52.547 4.9549 0.04594 * age 1 2.151 2.151 0.2028 0.66051 sex:age 1 0.130 0.130 0.0123 0.91355 Residuals 12 127.261 10.605 --- Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 Since the interaction term is neither substantial nor significant, we probably don’t need it here. But let’s look at its interpretation anyway, just to fix ideas. To do that, we’ll need the coefficients from the underlying regression model. tidy(lm(st_delta ~ sex * age, data = emph_imp)) term estimate std.error statistic p.value 1 (Intercept) -5.64606742 13.4536974 -0.4196666 0.6821446 2 sexM 1.72031026 16.8389209 0.1021627 0.9203148 3 age 0.03651685 0.2113871 0.1727488 0.8657284 4 sexM:age 0.02885946 0.2603044 0.1108681 0.9135536 Our ANCOVA model for st_delta incorporating the age x sex product term is -5.65 + 1.72 (sex = M) + 0.037 age + 0.029 (sex = M)(age). So that means: our model for females is st_delta = -5.65 + 0.037 age our model for males is st_delta = (-5.65 + 1.72) + (0.037 + 0.029) age, or -3.93 + 0.066 age but, again, our conclusion from the ANCOVA table is that this increase in complexity (letting both the slope and intercept vary by sex) doesn’t add much in the way of predictive value for our st_delta outcome. 4.7 Centering the Covariate to Facilitate ANCOVA Interpretation When developing an ANCOVA model, we will often center or even center and rescale the covariate to facilitate interpretation of the product term. In this case, let’s center age and rescale it by dividing by two standard deviations. emph_imp %&gt;% skim(age) Skim summary statistics n obs: 16 n variables: 7 Variable type: numeric variable missing complete n mean sd p0 p25 median p75 p100 age 0 16 16 65.2 6.98 50 63.5 65.1 70.25 76 Note that in our imputed data, the mean age is 65.2 and the standard deviation of age is 7 years. So we build the rescaled age variable that I’ll call age_z, and then use it to refit our model. emph_imp &lt;- emph_imp %&gt;% mutate(age_z = (age - mean(age))/ (2 * sd(age))) anova(lm(st_delta ~ sex * age_z, data = emph_imp)) Analysis of Variance Table Response: st_delta Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) sex 1 52.547 52.547 4.9549 0.04594 * age_z 1 2.151 2.151 0.2028 0.66051 sex:age_z 1 0.130 0.130 0.0123 0.91355 Residuals 12 127.261 10.605 --- Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 tidy(lm(st_delta ~ sex * age_z, data = emph_imp)) term estimate std.error statistic p.value 1 (Intercept) -3.2651685 1.386802 -2.3544587 0.03641637 2 sexM 3.6019471 1.735706 2.0752055 0.06013138 3 age_z 0.5096337 2.950144 0.1727488 0.86572835 4 sexM:age_z 0.4027661 3.632839 0.1108681 0.91355364 Comparing the two models, we have: (unscaled): st_delta = -5.65 + 1.72 (sex = M) + 0.037 age + 0.029 (sex = M) x (age) (rescaled): st_delta = -3.27 + 3.60 (sex = M) + 0.510 rescaled age_z + 0.402 (sex = M) x (rescaled age_z) In essence, the rescaled model on age_z is: st_delta = -3.27 + 0.510 age_z for female subjects, and st_delta = (-3.27 + 3.60) + (0.510 + 0.402) age_z = 0.33 + 0.912 age_z for male subjects Interpreting the centered, rescaled model, we have: no change in the ANOVA results or R-squared or residual standard deviation compared to the uncentered, unscaled model, but the intercept (-3.27) now represents the st_delta for a female of average age, the sex slope (3.60) represents the (male - female) difference in predicted st_delta for a person of average age, the age_z slope (0.510) represents the difference in predicted st_delta for a female one standard deviation older than the mean age as compared to a female one standard deviation younger than the mean age, and the product term’s slope (0.402) represents the male - female difference in the slope of age_z, so that if you add the age_z slope (0.510) and the interaction slope (0.402) you see the difference in predicted st_delta for a male one standard deviation older than the mean age as compared to a male one standard deviation younger than the mean age.

MCAR = Missingness completely at random. A variable is missing completely at random if the probability of missingness is the same for all units, for example, if for each subject, we decide whether to collect the diabetes status by rolling a die and refusing to answer if a “6” shows up. If data are missing completely at random, then throwing out cases with missing data does not bias your inferences. Missingness that depends only on observed predictors. A more general assumption, called missing at random or MAR, is that the probability a variable is missing depends only on available information. Here, we would have to be willing to assume that the probability of nonresponse to diabetes depends only on the other, fully recorded variables in the data. It is often reasonable to model this process as a logistic regression, where the outcome variable equals 1 for observed cases and 0 for missing. When an outcome variable is missing at random, it is acceptable to exclude the missing cases (that is, to treat them as NA), as long as the regression controls for all the variables that affect the probability of missingness. Missingness that depends on unobserved predictors. Missingness is no longer “at random” if it depends on information that has not been recorded and this information also predicts the missing values. If a particular treatment causes discomfort, a patient is more likely to drop out of the study. This missingness is not at random (unless “discomfort” is measured and observed for all patients). If missingness is not at random, it must be explicitly modeled, or else you must accept some bias in your inferences. Missingness that depends on the missing value itself. Finally, a particularly difficult situation arises when the probability of missingness depends on the (potentially missing) variable itself. For example, suppose that people with higher earnings are less likely to reveal them. Essentially, situations 3 and 4 are referred to collectively as non-random missingness, and cause more trouble for us than 1 and 2. 5.3 Options for Dealing with Missingness There are several available methods for dealing with missing data that are MCAR or MAR, but they basically boil down to: Complete Case (or Available Case) analyses Single Imputation Multiple Imputation 5.4 Complete Case (and Available Case) analyses In Complete Case analyses, rows containing NA values are omitted from the data before analyses commence. This is the default approach for many statistical software packages, and may introduce unpredictable bias and fail to include some useful, often hard-won information. A complete case analysis can be appropriate when the number of missing observations is not large, and the missing pattern is either MCAR (missing completely at random) or MAR (missing at random.) Two problems arise with complete-case analysis: If the units with missing values differ systematically from the completely observed cases, this could bias the complete-case analysis. If many variables are included in a model, there may be very few complete cases, so that most of the data would be discarded for the sake of a straightforward analysis. A related approach is available-case analysis where different aspects of a problem are studied with different subsets of the data, perhaps identified on the basis of what is missing in them. 5.5 Single Imputation In single imputation analyses, NA values are estimated/replaced one time with one particular data value for the purpose of obtaining more complete samples, at the expense of creating some potential bias in the eventual conclusions or obtaining slightly less accurate estimates than would be available if there were no missing values in the data. A single imputation can be just a replacement with the mean or median (for a quantity) or the mode (for a categorical variable.) However, such an approach, though easy to understand, underestimates variance and ignores the relationship of missing values to other variables. Single imputation can also be done using a variety of models to try to capture information about the NA values that are available in other variables within the data set. The simputation package can help us execute single imputations using a wide variety of techniques, within the pipe approach used by the tidyverse. Another approach I have used in the past is the mice package, which can also perform single imputations. 5.6 Multiple Imputation Multiple imputation, where NA values are repeatedly estimated/replaced with multiple data values, for the purpose of obtaining mode complete samples and capturing details of the variation inherent in the fact that the data have missingness, so as to obtain more accurate estimates than are possible with single imputation. We’ll postpone the discussion of multiple imputation for a while. 5.7 Building a Complete Case Analysis We can drop all of the missing values from a data set with drop_na or with na.omit or by filtering for complete.cases. Any of these approaches produces the same result - a new data set with 9 rows (after dropping the six subjects with any NA values) and 5 columns. cc.1 &lt;- na.omit(sbp_example) cc.2 &lt;- sbp_example %&gt;% drop_na cc.3 &lt;- sbp_example %&gt;% filter(complete.cases(.)) 5.8 Single Imputation with the Mean or Mode The most straightforward approach to single imputation is to impute a single summary of the variable, such as the mean, median or mode. skim(sbp_example) Skim summary statistics n obs: 15 n variables: 5 Variable type: factor variable missing complete n n_unique top_counts ordered treat 1 14 15 3 A: 6, B: 4, C: 4, NA: 1 FALSE Variable type: integer variable missing complete n mean sd p0 p25 median p75 p100 subject 0 15 15 108 4.47 101 104.5 108 111.5 115 Variable type: numeric variable missing complete n mean sd p0 p25 median p75 p100 diabetes 3 12 15 0.58 0.51 0 0 1 1 1 sbp.after 0 15 15 136 15.83 105 125 135 150 160 sbp.before 3 12 15 143.33 15.72 115 135 145 151.25 170 Here, suppose we decide to impute sbp.before with the mean (143.33) among non-missing values, diabetes with its median (1) among non-missing values, and treat with its most common value, or mode (A) si.1 &lt;- sbp_example %&gt;% replace_na(list(sbp.before = 143.33, diabetes = 1, treat = &quot;A&quot;)) si.1 # A tibble: 15 x 5 subject treat diabetes sbp.before sbp.after &lt;int&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 101 A 1. 120. 105. 2 102 B 0. 145. 135. 3 103 C 0. 150. 150. 4 104 A 1. 143. 120. 5 105 C 1. 155. 135. 6 106 A 1. 143. 115. 7 107 A 0. 135. 160. 8 108 A 1. 143. 150. 9 109 B 1. 115. 130. 10 110 C 1. 170. 155. 11 111 A 0. 150. 140. 12 112 B 0. 145. 140. 13 113 C 1. 140. 150. 14 114 A 1. 160. 135. 15 115 B 1. 135. 120. We could accomplish the same thing with, for example: si.2 &lt;- sbp_example %&gt;% replace_na(list(sbp.before = mean(sbp_example$sbp.before, na.rm = TRUE), diabetes = median(sbp_example$diabetes, na.rm = TRUE), treat = &quot;A&quot;)) 5.9 Doing Single Imputation with simputation Single imputation is a potentially appropriate method when missingness can be assumed to be either completely at random (MCAR) or dependent only on observed predictors (MAR). We’ll use the simputation package to accomplish it. The simputation vignette is available at https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/simputation/vignettes/intro.html The simputation reference manual is available at https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/simputation/simputation.pdf 5.9.1 Mirroring Our Prior Approach (imputing means/medians/modes) Suppose we want to mirror what we did above, simply impute the mean for sbp.before and the median for diabetes again. si.3 &lt;- sbp_example %&gt;% impute_lm(sbp.before ~ 1) %&gt;% impute_median(diabetes ~ 1) %&gt;% replace_na(list(treat = &quot;A&quot;)) si.3 # A tibble: 15 x 5 subject treat diabetes sbp.before sbp.after * &lt;int&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 101 A 1. 120. 105. 2 102 B 0. 145. 135. 3 103 C 0. 150. 150. 4 104 A 1. 143. 120. 5 105 C 1. 155. 135. 6 106 A 1. 143. 115. 7 107 A 0. 135. 160. 8 108 A 1. 143. 150. 9 109 B 1. 115. 130. 10 110 C 1. 170. 155. 11 111 A 0. 150. 140. 12 112 B 0. 145. 140. 13 113 C 1. 140. 150. 14 114 A 1. 160. 135. 15 115 B 1. 135. 120. 5.9.2 Using a model to impute sbp.before and diabetes Suppose we wanted to use: a robust linear model to predict sbp.before missing values, on the basis of sbp.after and diabetes status, and a predictive mean matching approach to predict diabetes status, on the basis of sbp.after, and a decision tree approach to predict treat status, using all other variables in the data set.seed(50001) imp.4 &lt;- sbp_example %&gt;% impute_rlm(sbp.before ~ sbp.after + diabetes) %&gt;% impute_pmm(diabetes ~ sbp.after) %&gt;% impute_cart(treat ~ .) imp.4 # A tibble: 15 x 5 subject treat diabetes sbp.before sbp.after * &lt;int&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 101 A 1. 120. 105. 2 102 B 0. 145. 135. 3 103 C 0. 150. 150. 4 104 A 1. 139. 120. 5 105 C 1. 155. 135. 6 106 A 1. 136. 115. 7 107 A 0. 135. 160. 8 108 A 1. 155. 150. 9 109 B 1. 115. 130. 10 110 C 1. 170. 155. 11 111 A 0. 150. 140. 12 112 B 0. 145. 140. 13 113 C 1. 140. 150. 14 114 A 1. 160. 135. 15 115 B 1. 135. 120. Details on the many available methods in simputation are provided in its manual. These include: impute_cart uses a Classification and Regression Tree approach for numerical or categorical data. There is also an impute_rf command which uses Random Forests for imputation. impute_pmm is one of several “hot deck” options for imputation, this one is predictive mean matching, which can be used with numeric data (only). Missing values are first imputed using a predictive model. Next, these predictions are replaced with the observed values which are nearest to the prediction. Other imputation options in this group include random hot deck, sequential hot deck and k-nearest neighbor imputation. impute_rlm is one of several regression imputation methods, including linear models, robust linear models (which use what is called M-estimation to impute numerical variables) and lasso/elastic net/ridge regression models. The simputation package can also do EM-based multivariate imputation, and multivariate random forest imputation, and several other approaches. References "],

As this combination value increases, the rate at which the cancer grows and spreads should increase. This score refers to the combined Gleason grade, which is based on the sum of two areas (each scored 1-5) that make up most of the cancer.] in a biopsy, and higher scores indicate more aggressive cancer cells. It’s stored here as 6, 7, or &gt; 7. the pgg45 variable captures the percentage of individual Gleason scores[^The 1-5 scale for individual biopsies are defined so that 1 indicates something that looks like normal prostate tissue, and 5 indicates that the cells and their growth patterns look very abnormal. In this study, the percentage of 4s and 5s shown in the data appears to be based on 5-20 individual scores in most subjects.] that are 4 or 5, on a 1-5 scale, where higher scores indicate more abnormal cells. 6.3 Additions for Later Use The code below adds to the prost tibble: a factor version of the svi variable, called svi_f, with levels No and Yes, a factor version of gleason called gleason_f, with the levels ordered &gt; 7, 7, and finally 6, a factor version of bph called bph_f, with levels ordered Low, Medium, High, a centered version of lcavol called lcavol_c, exponentiated cavol and psa results derived from the natural logarithms lcavol and lpsa. prost &lt;- prost %&gt;% mutate(svi_f = fct_recode(factor(svi), &quot;No&quot; = &quot;0&quot;, &quot;Yes&quot; = &quot;1&quot;), gleason_f = fct_relevel(gleason, c(&quot;&gt; 7&quot;, &quot;7&quot;, &quot;6&quot;)), bph_f = fct_relevel(bph, c(&quot;Low&quot;, &quot;Medium&quot;, &quot;High&quot;)), lcavol_c = lcavol - mean(lcavol), cavol = exp(lcavol), psa = exp(lpsa)) glimpse(prost) Observations: 97 Variables: 16 $ subject &lt;int&gt; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 1... $ lpsa &lt;dbl&gt; -0.4307829, -0.1625189, -0.1625189, -0.1625189, 0.37... $ lcavol &lt;dbl&gt; -0.5798185, -0.9942523, -0.5108256, -1.2039728, 0.75... $ lweight &lt;dbl&gt; 2.769459, 3.319626, 2.691243, 3.282789, 3.432373, 3.... $ age &lt;int&gt; 50, 58, 74, 58, 62, 50, 64, 58, 47, 63, 65, 63, 63, ... $ bph &lt;fct&gt; Low, Low, Low, Low, Low, Low, Medium, High, Low, Low... $ svi &lt;int&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0... $ lcp &lt;dbl&gt; -1.3862944, -1.3862944, -1.3862944, -1.3862944, -1.3... $ gleason &lt;fct&gt; 6, 6, 7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 6, 7, 6... $ pgg45 &lt;int&gt; 0, 0, 20, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 30, 5, 5, 0, 30... $ svi_f &lt;fct&gt; No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, ... $ gleason_f &lt;fct&gt; 6, 6, 7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 6, 7, 6... $ bph_f &lt;fct&gt; Low, Low, Low, Low, Low, Low, Medium, High, Low, Low... $ lcavol_c &lt;dbl&gt; -1.9298281, -2.3442619, -1.8608352, -2.5539824, -0.5... $ cavol &lt;dbl&gt; 0.56, 0.37, 0.60, 0.30, 2.12, 0.35, 2.09, 2.00, 0.46... $ psa &lt;dbl&gt; 0.65, 0.85, 0.85, 0.85, 1.45, 2.15, 2.15, 2.35, 2.85... 6.4 Fitting and Evaluating a Two-Predictor Model To begin, let’s use two predictors (lcavol and svi) and their interaction in a linear regression model that predicts lpsa. I’ll call this model c5_prost_A Earlier, we centered the lcavol values to facilitate interpretation of the terms. I’ll use that centered version (called lcavol_c) of the quantitative predictor, and the 1/0 version of the svi variable[^We could certainly use the factor version of svi here, but it won’t change the model in any meaningful way. There’s no distinction in model fitting via lm between a 0/1 numeric variable and a No/Yes factor variable. The factor version of this information will be useful elsewhere, for instance in plotting the model.]. c5_prost_A &lt;- lm(lpsa ~ lcavol_c * svi, data = prost) summary(c5_prost_A) Call: lm(formula = lpsa ~ lcavol_c * svi, data = prost) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.6305 -0.5007 0.1266 0.4886 1.6847 Coefficients: Estimate Std.

For example, to specify the coefficient for svi, rounded to three decimal places, I could use tidy(c5_prost_A) %&gt;% filter(term == &quot;svi&quot;) %&gt;% select(estimate) %&gt;% round(., 3) The result is 0.601. If you look at the Markdown file, you’ll see that the number shown in the bullet point above this one was generated using inline R code, and the function specified above. 6.4.2 Interpretation The intercept, 2.33, for the model is the predicted value of lpsa when lcavol is at its average and there is no seminal vesicle invasion (e.g. svi = 0). The coefficient for lcavol_c, 0.59, is the predicted change in lpsa associated with a one unit increase in lcavol (or lcavol_c) when there is no seminal vesicle invasion. The coefficient for svi, 0.60, is the predicted change in lpsa associated with having no svi to having an svi while the lcavol remains at its average. The coefficient for lcavol_c:svi, the product term, which is 0.06, is the difference in the slope of lcavol_c for a subject with svi as compared to one with no svi. Note: If you look at the R Markdown, you’ll notice that in bullet point 3, I didn’t use round to round off the estimate (as I did in the other three bullets), but instead a special function I specified at the start of the R Markdown file called specify_decimal() which uses the format function. This forces, in this case, the trailing zero in the two decimal representation of the svi coefficient to be shown. The special function, again, is: specify_decimal &lt;- function(x, k) format(round(x, k), nsmall=k) 6.5 Exploring Model c5_prost_A The glance function from the broom package builds a nice one-row summary for the model. glance(c5_prost_A) r.squared adj.r.squared sigma statistic p.value df logLik 1 0.5806435 0.5671158 0.7594785 42.92278 1.678836e-17 4 -108.9077 AIC BIC deviance df.residual 1 227.8153 240.6889 53.64311 93 This summary includes, in order, the model \\(R^2\\), adjusted \\(R^2\\) and \\(\\hat{\\sigma}\\), the residual standard deviation, the ANOVA F statistic and associated p value, the number of degrees of freedom used by the model, and its log-likelihood ratio the model’s AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) and BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion) the model’s deviance statistic and residual degrees of freedom 6.5.1 summary for Model c5_prost_A If necessary, we can also run summary on this c5_prost_A object to pick up some additional summaries. Since the svi variable is binary, the interaction term is, too, so the t test here and the F test in the ANOVA yield the same result. summary(c5_prost_A) Call: lm(formula = lpsa ~ lcavol_c * svi, data = prost) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.6305 -0.5007 0.1266 0.4886 1.6847 Coefficients: Estimate Std.

R2 will always suggest that we make our models as big as possible, often including variables of dubious predictive value. As a result, there are various methods for penalizing R2 so that we wind up with smaller models. The adjusted R2 is often a useful way to compare multiple models for the same response. \\(R^2_{adj} = 1 - \\frac{(1-R^2)(n - 1)}{n - k}\\), where \\(n\\) = the number of observations and \\(k\\) is the number of coefficients estimated by the regression (including the intercept and any slopes). So, in this case, \\(R^2_{adj} = 1 - \\frac{(1 - 0.5806)(97 - 1)}{97 - 4} = 0.5671\\) The adjusted R2 value is not, technically, a proportion of anything, but it is comparable across models for the same outcome. The adjusted R2 will always be less than the (unadjusted) R2. 6.5.3 Coefficient Confidence Intervals Here are the 90% confidence intervals for the coefficients in Model A. Adjust the level to get different intervals. confint(c5_prost_A, level = 0.90) 5 % 95 % (Intercept) 2.17968697 2.4830012 lcavol_c 0.45004577 0.7227462 svi 0.00599401 1.1966454 lcavol_c:svi -0.37737623 0.5069622 What can we conclude from this about the utility of the interaction term? 6.5.4 ANOVA for Model c5_prost_A The interaction term appears unnecessary. We might wind up fitting the model without it. A complete ANOVA test is available, including a p value, if you want it. anova(c5_prost_A) Analysis of Variance Table Response: lpsa Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) lcavol_c 1 69.003 69.003 119.6289 &lt; 2.2e-16 *** svi 1 5.237 5.237 9.0801 0.003329 ** lcavol_c:svi 1 0.034 0.034 0.0593 0.808191 Residuals 93 53.643 0.577 --- Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 Note that the anova approach for a lm object is sequential. The first row shows the impact of lcavol_c as compared to a model with no predictors (just an intercept). The second row shows the impact of adding svi to a model that already contains lcavol_c. The third row shows the impact of adding the interaction (product) term to the model with the two main effects. So the order in which the variables are added to the regression model matters for this ANOVA. The F tests here describe the incremental impact of each covariate in turn. 6.5.5 Residuals, Fitted Values and Standard Errors with augment The augment function in the broom package builds a data frame including the data used in the model, along with predictions (fitted values), residuals and other useful information. c5_prost_A_frame &lt;- augment(c5_prost_A) %&gt;% tbl_df skim(c5_prost_A_frame) Skim summary statistics n obs: 97 n variables: 10 Variable type: integer variable missing complete n mean sd p0 p25 median p75 p100 svi 0 97 97 0.22 0.41 0 0 0 0 1 Variable type: numeric variable missing complete n mean sd p0 p25 median .cooksd 0 97 97 0.011 0.02 6.9e-06 0.00078 0.0035 .fitted 0 97 97 2.48 0.88 0.75 1.84 2.4 .hat 0 97 97 0.041 0.041 0.013 0.016 0.025 .resid 0 97 97 -6.9e-17 0.75 -1.63 -0.5 0.13 .se.fit 0 97 97 0.14 0.061 0.087 0.095 0.12 .sigma 0 97 97 0.76 0.0052 0.74 0.76 0.76 .std.resid 0 97 97 0.0012 1.01 -2.19 -0.69 0.17 lcavol_c 0 97 97 5.4e-17 1.18 -2.7 -0.84 0.097 lpsa 0 97 97 2.48 1.15 -0.43 1.73 2.59 p75 p100 0.01 0.13 3.07 4.54 0.049 0.25 0.49 1.68 0.17 0.38 0.76 0.76 0.65 2.26 0.78 2.47 3.06 5.58 Elements shown here include: .fitted Fitted values of model (or predicted values) .se.fit Standard errors of fitted values .resid Residuals (observed - fitted values) .hat Diagonal of the hat matrix (these indicate leverage - points with high leverage indicate unusual combinations of predictors - values more than 2-3 times the mean leverage are worth some study - leverage is always between 0 and 1, and measures the amount by which the predicted value would change if the observation’s y value was increased by one unit - a point with leverage 1 would cause the line to follow that point perfectly) .sigma Estimate of residual standard deviation when corresponding observation is dropped from model .cooksd Cook’s distance, which helps identify influential points (values of Cook’s d &gt; 0.5 may be influential, values &gt; 1.0 almost certainly are - an influential point changes the fit substantially when it is removed from the data) .std.resid Standardized residuals (values above 2 in absolute value are worth some study - treat these as normal deviates [Z scores], essentially) See ?augment.lm in R for more details. 6.5.6 Making Predictions with c5_prost_A Suppose we want to predict the lpsa for a patient with cancer volume equal to this group’s mean, for both a patient with and without seminal vesicle invasion, and in each case, we want to use a 90% prediction interval? newdata &lt;- data.frame(lcavol_c = c(0,0), svi = c(0,1)) predict(c5_prost_A, newdata, interval = &quot;prediction&quot;, level = 0.90) fit lwr upr 1 2.331344 1.060462 3.602226 2 2.932664 1.545742 4.319586 Since the predicted value in fit refers to the natural logarithm of PSA, to make the predictions in terms of PSA, we would need to exponentiate. The code below will accomplish that task. pred &lt;- predict(c5_prost_A, newdata, interval = &quot;prediction&quot;, level = 0.90) exp(pred) fit lwr upr 1 10.29177 2.887706 36.67978 2 18.77758 4.691450 75.15750 6.6 Plotting Model c5_prost_A 6.6.0.1 Plot logs conventionally Here, we’ll use ggplot2 to plot the logarithms of the variables as they came to us, on a conventional coordinate scale. Note that the lines are nearly parallel. What does this suggest about our Model A? ggplot(prost, aes(x = lcavol, y = lpsa, group = svi_f, color = svi_f)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, se = FALSE) + scale_color_discrete(name = &quot;Seminal Vesicle Invasion?&quot;) + theme_bw() + labs(x = &quot;Log (cancer volume, cc)&quot;, y = &quot;Log (Prostate Specific Antigen, ng/ml)&quot;, title = &quot;Two Predictor Model c5_prost_A, including Interaction&quot;) 6.6.0.2 Plot on log-log scale Another approach (which might be easier in some settings) would be to plot the raw values of Cancer Volume and PSA, but use logarithmic axes, again using the natural (base e) logarithm, as follows. If we use the default choice with `trans = “log”, we’ll find a need to select some useful break points for the grid, as I’ve done in what follows. ggplot(prost, aes(x = cavol, y = psa, group = svi_f, color = svi_f)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, se = FALSE) + scale_color_discrete(name = &quot;Seminal Vesicle Invasion?&quot;) + scale_x_continuous(trans = &quot;log&quot;, breaks = c(0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50)) + scale_y_continuous(trans = &quot;log&quot;, breaks = c(1, 2, 4, 10, 25, 50, 100, 200)) + theme_bw() + labs(x = &quot;Cancer volume, in cubic centimeters&quot;, y = &quot;Prostate Specific Antigen, in ng/ml&quot;, title = &quot;Two Predictor Model c5_prost_A, including Interaction&quot;) I’ve used the break point of 4 on the Y axis because of the old rule suggesting further testing for asymptomatic men with PSA of 4 or higher, but the other break points are arbitrary - they seemed to work for me, and used round numbers. 6.6.1 Residual Plots of c5_prost_A plot(c5_prost_A, which = 1) plot(c5_prost_A, which = 5) 6.7 Cross-Validation of Model c5_prost_A Suppose we want to evaluate whether our model c5_prost_A predicts effectively in new data. One approach (used, for instance, in 431) would be to split our sample into a separate training (perhaps 70% of the data) and test (perhaps 30% of the data) samples, and then: fit the model in the training sample, use the resulting model to make predictions for lpsa in the test sample, and evaluate the quality of those predictions, perhaps by comparing the results to what we’d get using a different model. One problem with this approach is that with a small data set like this, we may be reluctant to cut our sample size for the training or the testing down because we’re afraid that our model building and testing will be hampered by a small sample size. A potential solution is the idea of cross-validation, which involves partitioning our data into a series of training-test subsets, multiple times, and then combining the results. The rest of this section is built on some material by David Robinson at https://rpubs.com/dgrtwo/cv-modelr. Suppose that we want to perform what is called 10-crossfold separation. In words, this approach splits the 97 observations in our prost data frame into 10 exclusive partitions of about 90% (so about 87-88 observations) into a training sample, and the remaining 10% (9-10 observations) in a test sample8. We then refit a model of interest using the training data, and fit the resulting model on the test data using the broom package’s augment function. This process is then repeated (a total of 10 times) so that each observation is used 9 times in the training sample, and once in the test sample. To code this in R, we’ll make use of a few new ideas. Our goal will be to cross-validate model c5_prost_A, which, you’ll recall, uses lcavol_c, svi and their interaction, to predict lpsa in the prost data. First, we set a seed for the validation algorithm, so we can replicate our results down the line. Then we use the crossv_kfold function from the modelr package to split the prost data into ten different partitions, and then use each partition for a split into training and test samples, which the machine indexes with train and test. Then we use some magic and the map function from the purrr package (part of the core tidyverse) to fit a new lm(lpsa ~ lcavol_c * svi) model to each of the training samples generated by crossv_kfold. Finally, some additional magic with the unnest and map2 functions applies each of these new models to the appropriate test sample, and generate predictions (.fitted) and standard errors for each prediction (.se.fit). set.seed(4320308) prost_models &lt;- prost %&gt;% crossv_kfold(k = 10) %&gt;% mutate(model = map(train, ~ lm(lpsa ~ lcavol_c * svi, data = .))) prost_predictions &lt;- prost_models %&gt;% unnest(map2(model, test, ~ augment(.x, newdata = .y))) head(prost_predictions) # A tibble: 6 x 19 .id subject lpsa lcavol lweight age bph svi lcp gleason &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;fct&gt; 1 01 3 -0.163 -0.511 2.69 74 Low 0 -1.39 7 2 01 12 1.27 -1.35 3.60 63 Medium 0 -1.39 6 3 01 16 1.45 1.54 3.06 66 Low 0 -1.39 6 4 01 18 1.49 2.29 3.65 66 Low 0 0.372 6 5 01 30 1.89 2.41 3.38 65 Low 0 1.62 6 6 01 34 2.02 0.00995 3.27 54 Low 0 -1.39 6 # ... with 9 more variables: pgg45 &lt;int&gt;, svi_f &lt;fct&gt;, gleason_f &lt;fct&gt;, # bph_f &lt;fct&gt;, lcavol_c &lt;dbl&gt;, cavol &lt;dbl&gt;, psa &lt;dbl&gt;, .fitted &lt;dbl&gt;, # .se.fit &lt;dbl&gt; The results are a set of predictions based on the splits into training and test groups (remember there are 10 such splits, indexed by .id) that describe the complete set of 97 subjects again. 6.7.1 Cross-Validated Summaries of Prediction Quality Now, we can calculate the root Mean Squared Prediction Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Prediction Error (MAE) for this modeling approach (using lcavol_c and svi to predict lpsa) across these observations. prost_predictions %&gt;% summarize(RMSE_ourmodel = sqrt(mean((lpsa - .fitted) ^2)), MAE_ourmodel = mean(abs(lpsa - .fitted))) # A tibble: 1 x 2 RMSE_ourmodel MAE_ourmodel &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0.783 0.638 For now, we’ll compare our model to the “intercept only” model that simply predicts the mean lpsa across all patients. prost_predictions %&gt;% summarize(RMSE_intercept = sqrt(mean((lpsa - mean(lpsa)) ^2)), MAE_intercept = mean(abs(lpsa - mean(lpsa)))) # A tibble: 1 x 2 RMSE_intercept MAE_intercept &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1.15 0.891 So our model looks meaningfully better than the “intercept only” model, in that both the RMSE and MAE are much lower (better) with our model. Another thing we could do with this tibble of predictions we have created is to graph the size of the prediction errors (observed lpsa minus predicted values in .fitted) that our modeling approach makes. prost_predictions %&gt;% mutate(errors = lpsa - .fitted) %&gt;% ggplot(., aes(x = errors)) + geom_histogram(bins = 30, fill = &quot;darkviolet&quot;, col = &quot;yellow&quot;) + labs(title = &quot;Cross-Validated Errors in Prediction of log(PSA)&quot;, subtitle = &quot;Using a model (`c5_prostA`) including lcavol_c and svi and their interaction&quot;, x = &quot;Error in predicting log(PSA)&quot;) This suggests that some of our results are off by quite a bit, on the log(PSA) scale, which is summarized for the original data below. prost %&gt;% skim(lpsa) Skim summary statistics n obs: 97 n variables: 16 Variable type: numeric variable missing complete n mean sd p0 p25 median p75 p100 lpsa 0 97 97 2.48 1.15 -0.43 1.73 2.59 3.06 5.58 If we like, we could transform the predictions and observed values back to the scale of PSA (unlogged) and then calculate and display errors, as follows: prost_predictions %&gt;% mutate(err.psa = exp(lpsa) - exp(.fitted)) %&gt;% ggplot(., aes(x = err.psa)) + geom_histogram(bins = 30, fill = &quot;darkorange&quot;, col = &quot;yellow&quot;) + labs(title = &quot;Cross-Validated Errors in Prediction of PSA&quot;, subtitle = &quot;Using a model (`c5_prostA`) including lcavol_c and svi and their interaction&quot;, x = &quot;Error in predicting PSA&quot;) This suggests that some of our results are off by quite a bit, on the original scale of PSA, which is summarized below. prost %&gt;% mutate(psa = exp(lpsa)) %&gt;% skim(psa) Skim summary statistics n obs: 97 n variables: 16 Variable type: numeric variable missing complete n mean sd p0 p25 median p75 p100 psa 0 97 97 23.74 40.83 0.65 5.65 13.35 21.25 265.85 We’ll return to the notion of cross-validation again, but for now, let’s consider the problem of considering adding more predictors to our model, and then making sensible selections as to which predictors actually should be incorporated.

L. Ramsey and Schafer (2002) suggest a strategy for dealing with many potential explanatory variables should include the following elements: Identify the key objectives. Screen the available variables, deciding on a list that is sensitive to the objectives and excludes obvious redundancies. Perform exploratory analysis, examining graphical displays and correlation coefficients. Perform transformations, as necessary. Examine a residual plot after fitting a rich model, performing further transformations and considering outliers. Find a suitable subset of the predictors, exerting enough control over any semi-automated selection procedure to be sensitive to the questions of interest. Proceed with the analysis, using the selected explanatory variables. The Two Key Aspects of Model Selection are: Evaluating each potential subset of predictor variables Deciding on the collection of potential subsets 7.1.1 How Do We Choose Potential Subsets of Predictors? Choosing potential subsets of predictor variables usually involves either: Stepwise approaches All possible subset (or best possible subset) searches Note that the use of any variable selection procedure changes the properties of … the estimated coefficients, which are biased, and the associated tests and confidence intervals, which are overly optimistic. Leeb and Potscher (2005) summarize the key issues: Regardless of sample size, the model selection step typically has a dramatic effect on the sampling properties of the estimators that cannot be ignored. In particular, the sampling properties of post-model-selection estimators are typically significantly different from the nominal distributions that arise if a fixed model is supposed. As a consequence, use of inference procedures that do not take into account the model selection step (e.g. using standard t-intervals as if the selected model has been given prior to the statistical analysis) can be highly misleading. 7.2 A “Kitchen Sink” Model (Model c5_prost_ks) Suppose that we now consider a model for the prost data we have been working with, which includes main effects (and, in this case, only the main effects) of all eight candidate predictors for lpsa, as follows. c5_prost_ks &lt;- lm(lpsa ~ lcavol + lweight + age + bph_f + svi_f + lcp + gleason_f + pgg45, data = prost) tidy(c5_prost_ks) term estimate std.error statistic p.value 1 (Intercept) 0.169937821 0.931332512 0.1824674 8.556454e-01 2 lcavol 0.544313829 0.087979210 6.1868461 2.010505e-08 3 lweight 0.702237531 0.203013089 3.4590751 8.455164e-04 4 age -0.023857982 0.011081414 -2.1529727 3.412099e-02 5 bph_fMedium 0.364036274 0.182575941 1.9938896 4.933267e-02 6 bph_fHigh 0.248789989 0.195975792 1.2694935 2.076898e-01 7 svi_fYes 0.710949408 0.241990241 2.9379259 4.240326e-03 8 lcp -0.119311781 0.089458946 -1.3337043 1.858223e-01 9 gleason_f7 0.220746268 0.343065609 0.6434520 5.216430e-01 10 gleason_f6 -0.053096704 0.430098039 -0.1234526 9.020368e-01 11 pgg45 0.003984574 0.004146495 0.9609499 3.392714e-01 glance(c5_prost_ks) r.squared adj.r.squared sigma statistic p.value df logLik 1 0.6790343 0.6417127 0.6909479 18.19414 2.373796e-17 11 -95.93939 AIC BIC deviance df.residual 1 215.8788 246.7753 41.05718 86 We’ll often refer to this (all predictors on board) approach as a “kitchen sink” model[This refers to the English idiom “… everything but the kitchen sink” which describes, essentially, everything imaginable. A “kitchen sink regression” is often used as a pejorative term, since no special skill or insight is required to identify it, given a list of potential predictors. For more, yes, there is a Wikipedia page.]. 7.3 Sequential Variable Selection: Stepwise Approaches Forward Selection We begin with a constant mean and then add potential predictors one at a time according to some criterion (R defaults to minimizing the Akaike Information Criterion) until no further addition significantly improves the fit. Each categorical factor variable is represented in the regression model as a set of indicator variables. In the absence of a good reason to do something else, the set is added to the model as a single unit, and R does this automatically. Backwards Elimination Start with the “kitchen sink” model and then delete potential predictors one at a time. Backwards Elimination is less likely than Forward Selection to omit negatively confounded sets of variables, though all stepwise procedures have problems. Stepwise Regression can also be done by combining these methods. 7.3.1 The Big Problems with Stepwise Regression There is no reason to assume that a single best model can be found. The use of forward selection, or backwards elimination, or stepwise regression including both procedures, will NOT always find the same model. It also appears to be essentially useless to try different stepwise methods to look for agreement. Users of stepwise regression frequently place all of their attention on the particular explanatory variables included in the resulting model, when there’s no reason (in most cases) to assume that model is in any way optimal. Despite all of its problems, let’s use stepwise regression to help predict lpsa given a subset of the eight predictors in c5_prost_ks. 7.4 Forward Selection with the step function Specify the null model (intercept only) Specify the variables R should consider as predictors (in the scope element of the step function) Specify forward selection only R defaults to using AIC as its stepwise criterion with(prost, step(lm(lpsa ~ 1), scope=(~ lcavol + lweight + age + bph_f + svi_f + lcp + gleason_f + pgg45), direction=&quot;forward&quot;)) Start: AIC=28.84 lpsa ~ 1 Df Sum of Sq RSS AIC + lcavol 1 69.003 58.915 -44.366 + svi_f 1 41.011 86.907 -6.658 + lcp 1 38.528 89.389 -3.926 + gleason_f 2 30.121 97.796 6.793 + lweight 1 24.019 103.899 10.665 + pgg45 1 22.814 105.103 11.783 + age 1 3.679 124.239 28.007 &lt;none&gt; 127.918 28.838 + bph_f 2 4.681 123.237 29.221 Step: AIC=-44.37 lpsa ~ lcavol Df Sum of Sq RSS AIC + lweight 1 7.1726 51.742 -54.958 + svi_f 1 5.2375 53.677 -51.397 + bph_f 2 3.2994 55.615 -45.956 + pgg45 1 1.6980 57.217 -45.203 + gleason_f 2 2.7834 56.131 -45.061 &lt;none&gt; 58.915 -44.366 + lcp 1 0.6562 58.259 -43.452 + age 1 0.0025 58.912 -42.370 Step: AIC=-54.96 lpsa ~ lcavol + lweight Df Sum of Sq RSS AIC + svi_f 1 5.1737 46.568 -63.177 + pgg45 1 1.8158 49.926 -56.424 + gleason_f 2 2.6770 49.065 -56.111 &lt;none&gt; 51.742 -54.958 + lcp 1 0.8187 50.923 -54.506 + age 1 0.6456 51.097 -54.176 + bph_f 2 1.4583 50.284 -53.731 Step: AIC=-63.18 lpsa ~ lcavol + lweight + svi_f Df Sum of Sq RSS AIC &lt;none&gt; 46.568 -63.177 + gleason_f 2 1.60467 44.964 -62.579 + age 1 0.62301 45.945 -62.484 + bph_f 2 1.50046 45.068 -62.354 + pgg45 1 0.50069 46.068 -62.226 + lcp 1 0.06937 46.499 -61.322 Call: lm(formula = lpsa ~ lcavol + lweight + svi_f) Coefficients: (Intercept) lcavol lweight svi_fYes -0.7772 0.5259 0.6618 0.6657 The resulting model, arrived at after three forward selection steps, includes lcavol, lweight and svi_f. model.fs &lt;- lm(lpsa ~ lcavol + lweight + svi_f, data=prost) summary(model.fs)$adj.r.squared [1] 0.6242063 extractAIC(model.fs) [1] 4.00000 -63.17744 The adjusted R2 value for this model is 0.624, and the AIC value used by the stepwise procedure is -63.18, on 4 effective degrees of freedom. 7.5 Backward Elimination using the step function In this case, the backward elimination approach, using reduction in AIC for a criterion, comes to the same conclusion about the “best” model. with(prost, step(lm(lpsa ~ lcavol + lweight + age + bph_f + svi_f + lcp + gleason_f + pgg45), direction=&quot;backward&quot;)) Start: AIC=-61.4 lpsa ~ lcavol + lweight + age + bph_f + svi_f + lcp + gleason_f + pgg45 Df Sum of Sq RSS AIC - gleason_f 2 1.1832 42.240 -62.639 - pgg45 1 0.4409 41.498 -62.359 - lcp 1 0.8492 41.906 -61.409 &lt;none&gt; 41.057 -61.395 - bph_f 2 2.0299 43.087 -60.714 - age 1 2.2129 43.270 -58.303 - svi_f 1 4.1207 45.178 -54.118 - lweight 1 5.7123 46.769 -50.760 - lcavol 1 18.2738 59.331 -27.683 Step: AIC=-62.64 lpsa ~ lcavol + lweight + age + bph_f + svi_f + lcp + pgg45 Df Sum of Sq RSS AIC - lcp 1 0.8470 43.087 -62.713 &lt;none&gt; 42.240 -62.639 - pgg45 1 1.2029 43.443 -61.916 - bph_f 2 2.2515 44.492 -61.602 - age 1 2.0730 44.313 -59.992 - svi_f 1 4.6431 46.884 -54.523 - lweight 1 5.5988 47.839 -52.566 - lcavol 1 21.4956 63.736 -24.736 Step: AIC=-62.71 lpsa ~ lcavol + lweight + age + bph_f + svi_f + pgg45 Df Sum of Sq RSS AIC - pgg45 1 0.5860 43.673 -63.403 &lt;none&gt; 43.087 -62.713 - bph_f 2 2.0214 45.109 -62.266 - age 1 1.7101 44.798 -60.938 - svi_f 1 3.7964 46.884 -56.523 - lweight 1 5.6462 48.734 -52.769 - lcavol 1 22.5152 65.603 -23.936 Step: AIC=-63.4 lpsa ~ lcavol + lweight + age + bph_f + svi_f Df Sum of Sq RSS AIC &lt;none&gt; 43.673 -63.403 - bph_f 2 2.2720 45.945 -62.484 - age 1 1.3945 45.068 -62.354 - svi_f 1 5.2747 48.948 -54.343 - lweight 1 5.3319 49.005 -54.230 - lcavol 1 25.5538 69.227 -20.720 Call: lm(formula = lpsa ~ lcavol + lweight + age + bph_f + svi_f) Coefficients: (Intercept) lcavol lweight age bph_fMedium 0.14329 0.54022 0.67283 -0.01819 0.37607 bph_fHigh svi_fYes 0.27216 0.68174 The backwards elimination approach in this case lands on a model with five inputs (one of which includes two bph indicators,) eliminating only gleason_f, pgg45 and lcp. 7.6 Allen-Cady Modified Backward Elimination Ranking candidate predictors by importance in advance of backwards elimination can help avoid false-positives, while reducing model size. See Vittinghoff et al. (2012), Section 10.3 for more details. First, force into the model any predictors of primary interest, and any confounders necessary for face validity of the final model. “Some variables in the hypothesized causal model may be such well-established causal antecedents of the outcome that it makes sense to include them, essentially to establish the face validity of the model and without regard to the strength or statistical significance of their associations with the primary predictor and outcome …” Rank the remaining candidate predictors in order of importance. Starting from an initial model with all candidate predictors included, delete predictors in order of ascending importance until the first variable meeting a criterion to stay in the model hits. Then stop. Only the remaining variable hypothesized to be least important is eligible for removal at each step. When we are willing to do this sorting before collecting (or analyzing) the data, then we can do Allen-Cady backwards elimination using the drop1 command in R. 7.6.1 Demonstration of the Allen-Cady approach Suppose, for the moment that we decided to fit a model for the log of psa and we decided (before we saw the data) that we would: lcavol + lweight + svi_f + age + bph_f + gleason_f + lcp + pgg45 force the gleason_f variable to be in the model, due to prior information about its importance, and then rated the importance of the other variables as lcavol (most important), then svi_f then age, and then bph_f, then lweight and lcp followed by pgg45 (least important) When we are willing to do this sorting before collecting (or analyzing) the data, then we can do Allen-Cady backwards elimination using the drop1 command in R. Step 1. Fit the full model, then see if removing pgg45 improves AIC… with(prost, drop1(lm(lpsa ~ gleason_f + lcavol + svi_f + age + bph_f + lweight + lcp + pgg45), scope = (~ pgg45))) Single term deletions Model: lpsa ~ gleason_f + lcavol + svi_f + age + bph_f + lweight + lcp + pgg45 Df Sum of Sq RSS AIC &lt;none&gt; 41.057 -61.395 pgg45 1 0.44085 41.498 -62.359 Since -62.3 is smaller (i.e. more negative) than -61.4, we delete pgg45 and move on to assess whether we can remove the variable we deemed next least important (lcp) Step 2. Let’s see if removing lcp from this model improves AIC… with(prost, drop1(lm(lpsa ~ gleason_f + lcavol + svi_f + age + bph_f + lweight + lcp), scope = (~ lcp))) Single term deletions Model: lpsa ~ gleason_f + lcavol + svi_f + age + bph_f + lweight + lcp Df Sum of Sq RSS AIC &lt;none&gt; 41.498 -62.359 lcp 1 0.56767 42.066 -63.041 Again, since -63.0 is smaller than -62.4, we delete lcp and next assess whether we should delete lweight. Step 3. Does removing lweight from this model improves AIC… with(prost, drop1(lm(lpsa ~ gleason_f + lcavol + svi_f + age + bph_f + lweight), scope = (~ lweight))) Single term deletions Model: lpsa ~ gleason_f + lcavol + svi_f + age + bph_f + lweight Df Sum of Sq RSS AIC &lt;none&gt; 42.066 -63.041 lweight 1 5.678 47.744 -52.760 Since the AIC for the model after the removal of lweight is larger (i.e. less negative), we stop, and declare our final model by the Allen-Cady approach to include gleason_f, lcavol, svi_f, age, bph_f and lweight. 7.7 Summarizing the Results Method Suggested Predictors Forward selection lcavol, lweight, svi_f Backwards elimination lcavol, lweight, svi_f, age, bph_f Allen-Cady approach lcavol, lweight, svi_f, age, bph_f, gleason_f 7.7.1 In-Sample Testing and Summaries Since these models are nested in each other, let’s look at the summary statistics (like R2, and AIC) and also run an ANOVA-based comparison of these nested models to each other and to the model with the intercept alone, and the kitchen sink model with all available predictors. prost_m_int &lt;- lm(lpsa ~ 1, data = prost) prost_m_fw &lt;- lm(lpsa ~ lcavol + lweight + svi_f, data = prost) prost_m_bw &lt;- lm(lpsa ~ lcavol + lweight + svi_f + age + bph_f + gleason_f, data = prost) prost_m_ac &lt;- lm(lpsa ~ lcavol + lweight + svi_f + age + bph_f + gleason_f + lcp, data = prost) prost_m_ks &lt;- lm(lpsa ~ lcavol + lweight + svi_f + age + bph_f + gleason_f + lcp + pgg45, data = prost) 7.7.1.1 Model Fit Summaries (in-sample) from glance Here are the models, at a glance from the broom package. prost_sum &lt;- bind_rows(glance(prost_m_int), glance(prost_m_fw), glance(prost_m_bw), glance(prost_m_ac), glance(prost_m_ks)) %&gt;% round(., 3) prost_sum$names &lt;- c(&quot;intercept&quot;, &quot;lcavol + lweight + svi&quot;, &quot;... + age + bhp + gleason&quot;, &quot;... + lcp&quot;, &quot;... + pgg45&quot;) prost_sum &lt;- prost_sum %&gt;% select(names, r.squared, adj.r.squared, AIC, BIC, sigma, df, df.residual) prost_sum names r.squared adj.r.squared AIC BIC sigma 1 intercept 0.000 0.000 306.112 311.261 1.154 2 lcavol + lweight + svi 0.636 0.624 214.097 226.970 0.708 3 ... + age + bhp + gleason 0.671 0.641 214.233 239.980 0.691 4 ... + lcp 0.676 0.642 214.915 243.237 0.691 5 ... + pgg45 0.679 0.642 215.879 246.775 0.691 df df.residual 1 1 96 2 4 93 3 9 88 4 10 87 5 11 86 From these summaries, it looks like: the adjusted R2 is essentially indistinguishable between the three largest models, but a bit less strong with the three-predictor (4 df) model, and the AIC and BIC are (slightly) better (lower) with the three-predictor model (4 df) than any other. So we might be motivated by these summaries to select any of the three models we’re studying closely here. 7.7.1.2 Model Testing via ANOVA (in-sample) To obtain ANOVA-based test results, we’ll run… anova(prost_m_int, prost_m_fw, prost_m_bw, prost_m_ac, prost_m_ks) Analysis of Variance Table Model 1: lpsa ~ 1 Model 2: lpsa ~ lcavol + lweight + svi_f Model 3: lpsa ~ lcavol + lweight + svi_f + age + bph_f + gleason_f Model 4: lpsa ~ lcavol + lweight + svi_f + age + bph_f + gleason_f + lcp Model 5: lpsa ~ lcavol + lweight + svi_f + age + bph_f + gleason_f + lcp + pgg45 Res.Df RSS Df Sum of Sq F Pr(&gt;F) 1 96 127.918 2 93 46.568 3 81.349 56.7991 &lt;2e-16 *** 3 88 42.066 5 4.503 1.8863 0.1050 4 87 41.498 1 0.568 1.1891 0.2786 5 86 41.057 1 0.441 0.9234 0.3393 --- Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 What conclusions can we draw on the basis of these ANOVA tests? There is a statistically significant improvement in predictive value for Model 2 (the forward selection approach) as compared to Model 1 (the intercept only.) The ANOVA test comparing Model 5 (kitchen sink) to Model 4 (Allen-Cady result) shows no statistically significant improvement in predictive value. Neither does the ANOVA test comparing Model 3 to Model 2 or Model 4 to Model 3. This suggests that, if we are willing to let the ANOVA test decide our best model than that would be the model produced by forward selection, with predictors lcavol, lweight and svi_f. But we haven’t validated the models. If the purpose of the model is to predict new data, some sort of out-of-sample or cross-validation approach will be necessary, and Even if our goal isn’t prediction but merely description of the current data, we would still want to build diagnostic plots to regression assumptions in each model, and There is no reason to assume in advance that any of these models is in fact correct, or that any one of these stepwise approaches is necessarily better than any other, and The mere act of running a stepwise regression model, as we’ll see, can increase the bias in our findings if we accept the results at face value. So we’ll need some ways to validate the results once we complete the selection process. 7.7.2 Validating the Results of the Various Models We can use a 5-fold cross-validation approach to assess the predictions made by our potential models and then compare them. Let’s compare our three models: the three predictor model obtained by forward selection, including lcavol, lweight, and svi_f the five predictor model obtained by backwards elimination, including lcavol, lweight, svi_f, and also age, and bph_f the six predictor model obtained by the Allen-Cady approach, adding gleason_f to the previous model. Here’s the 5-fold validation work (and resulting RMSE and MAE estimates) for the three-predictor model. set.seed(43201012) prost3_models &lt;- prost %&gt;% crossv_kfold(k = 5) %&gt;% mutate(model = map(train, ~ lm(lpsa ~ lcavol + lweight + svi_f, data = .))) prost3_preds &lt;- prost3_models %&gt;% unnest(map2(model, test, ~ augment(.x, newdata = .y))) prost3_preds %&gt;% summarize(RMSE_prost3 = sqrt(mean((lpsa - .fitted) ^2)), MAE_prost3 = mean(abs(lpsa - .fitted))) # A tibble: 1 x 2 RMSE_prost3 MAE_prost3 &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0.745 0.587 Now, we’ll generate the RMSE and MAE estimates for the five-predictor model. set.seed(43206879) prost5_models &lt;- prost %&gt;% crossv_kfold(k = 5) %&gt;% mutate(model = map(train, ~ lm(lpsa ~ lcavol + lweight + svi_f + age + bph_f, data = .))) prost5_preds &lt;- prost5_models %&gt;% unnest(map2(model, test, ~ augment(.x, newdata = .y))) prost5_preds %&gt;% summarize(RMSE_prost5 = sqrt(mean((lpsa - .fitted) ^2)), MAE_prost5 = mean(abs(lpsa - .fitted))) # A tibble: 1 x 2 RMSE_prost5 MAE_prost5 &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0.750 0.581 And at last, we’ll generate the RMSE and MAE estimates for the six-predictor model. set.seed(43236198) prost6_models &lt;- prost %&gt;% crossv_kfold(k = 5) %&gt;% mutate(model = map(train, ~ lm(lpsa ~ lcavol + lweight + svi_f + age + bph_f + gleason_f, data = .))) prost6_preds &lt;- prost6_models %&gt;% unnest(map2(model, test, ~ augment(.x, newdata = .y))) prost6_preds %&gt;% summarize(RMSE_prost6 = sqrt(mean((lpsa - .fitted) ^2)), MAE_prost6 = mean(abs(lpsa - .fitted))) # A tibble: 1 x 2 RMSE_prost6 MAE_prost6 &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0.720 0.551 It appears that the six-predictor model does better than either of the other two approaches, with smaller RMSE and MAE. The three-predictor model does slightly better in terms of root mean square prediction error and slightly worse in terms of mean absolute prediction error than the five-predictor model. OK. A mixed bag, with different conclusions depending on which summary we want to look at. But of course, stepwise regression isn’t the only way to do variable selection. Let’s consider a broader range of potential predictor sets. References "],

Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC), which we try to minimize, and a Bias-Corrected version of AIC due to Hurvich and Tsai (1989), which we use when the sample size is small, specifically when the sample size \\(n\\) and the number of predictors being studied \\(k\\) are such that \\(n/k \\leq 40\\). We also try to minimize this bias-corrected AIC. Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), which we also try to minimize. Mallows’ Cp statistic, which we (essentially) try to minimize. Choosing between AIC and BIC can be challenging. For model selection purposes, there is no clear choice between AIC and BIC. Given a family of models, including the true model, the probability that BIC will select the correct model approaches one as the sample size n approaches infinity - thus BIC is asymptotically consistent, which AIC is not. [But, for practical purposes,] BIC often chooses models that are too simple [relative to AIC] because of its heavy penalty on complexity. Source: Hastie, Tibshriani, and Frideman (2001), page 208. Several useful tools for running “all subsets” or “best subsets” regression comparisons are developed in R’s leaps package. 8.2 Using regsubsets in the leaps package We can use the leaps package to obtain results in the prost study from looking at all possible subsets of the candidate predictors. The leaps package isn’t particularly friendly to the tidyverse. In particular, we cannot have any character variables in our predictor set. We specify our “kitchen sink” model, and apply the regsubsets function from leaps, which identifies the set of models. To start, we’ll ask R to find the one best subset (with 1 predictor variable [in addition to the intercept], then with 2 predictors, and then with each of 3, 4, … 8 predictor variables) according to an exhaustive search without forcing any of the variables to be in or out. Use the nvmax command within the regsubsets function to limit the number of regression inputs to a maximum. Use the nbest command to identify how many subsets you want to identify for each predictor count. If all of your predictors are quantitative or binary then you can skip the preds step, and simply place your kitchen sink model into regsubsets. But if you have multi-categorical variables (like gleason_f or svi_f in our case) then you must create a preds group, as follows. preds &lt;- with(prost, cbind(lcavol, lweight, age, bph_f, svi_f, lcp, gleason_f, pgg45)) rs.ks &lt;- regsubsets(preds, y = prost$lpsa, nvmax = 8, nbest = 1) rs.summ &lt;- summary(rs.ks) rs.summ Subset selection object 8 Variables (and intercept) Forced in Forced out lcavol FALSE FALSE lweight FALSE FALSE age FALSE FALSE bph_f FALSE FALSE svi_f FALSE FALSE lcp FALSE FALSE gleason_f FALSE FALSE pgg45 FALSE FALSE 1 subsets of each size up to 8 Selection Algorithm: exhaustive lcavol lweight age bph_f svi_f lcp gleason_f pgg45 1 ( 1 ) &quot;*&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2 ( 1 ) &quot;*&quot; &quot;*&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 3 ( 1 ) &quot;*&quot; &quot;*&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;*&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 4 ( 1 ) &quot;*&quot; &quot;*&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;*&quot; &quot;*&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 5 ( 1 ) &quot;*&quot; &quot;*&quot; &quot;*&quot; &quot;*&quot; &quot;*&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 6 ( 1 ) &quot;*&quot; &quot;*&quot; &quot;*&quot; &quot;*&quot; &quot;*&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;*&quot; &quot; &quot; 7 ( 1 ) &quot;*&quot; &quot;*&quot; &quot;*&quot; &quot;*&quot; &quot;*&quot; &quot;*&quot; &quot;*&quot; &quot; &quot; 8 ( 1 ) &quot;*&quot; &quot;*&quot; &quot;*&quot; &quot;*&quot; &quot;*&quot; &quot;*&quot; &quot;*&quot; &quot;*&quot; So… the best one-predictor model used lcavol the best two-predictor model used lcavol and lweight the best three-predictor model used lcavol, lweight and svi_f the best four-predictor model added bph_f, and the best five-predictor model added age the best six-input model added gleason_f, the best seven-input model added lcp, and the eight-input model adds pgg45. All of these “best subsets” are hierarchical, in that each model is a subset of the one below it. This isn’t inevitably true. To determine which model is best, we can plot key summaries of model fit (adjusted R2, Mallows’ \\(C_p\\), bias-corrected AIC, and BIC) using either base R plotting techniques (what I’ve done in the past) or ggplot2 (what I use now.) I’ll show both types of plotting approaches in the next two sections. 8.2.1 Identifying the models with which and outmat To see the models selected by the system, we use: rs.summ$which (Intercept) lcavol lweight age bph_f svi_f lcp gleason_f pgg45 1 TRUE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE 2 TRUE TRUE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE 3 TRUE TRUE TRUE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE 4 TRUE TRUE TRUE FALSE TRUE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE 5 TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE 6 TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE 7 TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE FALSE 8 TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE Another version of this formatted for printing is: rs.summ$outmat lcavol lweight age bph_f svi_f lcp gleason_f pgg45 1 ( 1 ) &quot;*&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2 ( 1 ) &quot;*&quot; &quot;*&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 3 ( 1 ) &quot;*&quot; &quot;*&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;*&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 4 ( 1 ) &quot;*&quot; &quot;*&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;*&quot; &quot;*&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 5 ( 1 ) &quot;*&quot; &quot;*&quot; &quot;*&quot; &quot;*&quot; &quot;*&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 6 ( 1 ) &quot;*&quot; &quot;*&quot; &quot;*&quot; &quot;*&quot; &quot;*&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;*&quot; &quot; &quot; 7 ( 1 ) &quot;*&quot; &quot;*&quot; &quot;*&quot; &quot;*&quot; &quot;*&quot; &quot;*&quot; &quot;*&quot; &quot; &quot; 8 ( 1 ) &quot;*&quot; &quot;*&quot; &quot;*&quot; &quot;*&quot; &quot;*&quot; &quot;*&quot; &quot;*&quot; &quot;*&quot; We built one subset of each size up to eight predictors, and if we add the intercept term, this means we have models of size k = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9. The models are: Size k Predictors included (besides intercept) 2 lcavol 3 lcavol and lweight 4 add svi_f 5 add bph_f 6 add age 7 add gleason_f 8 add lcp 9 add pgg45 8.3 Calculating bias-corrected AIC The bias-corrected AIC formula developed in Hurvich and Tsai (1989) requires three inputs: the residual sum of squares for a model the sample size (n) or number of observations used to fit the model the number of regression inputs, k, including the intercept, used in the model So, for a particular model fit to n observations, on k predictors (including the intercept) and a residual sum of squares equal to RSS, we have: \\[ AIC_c = n log(\\frac{RSS}{n}) + 2k + \\frac{2k (k+1)}{n-k-1} \\] Note that the corrected \\(AIC_c\\) can be related to the original AIC via: \\[ AIC_c = AIC + \\frac{2k (k+1)}{n - k - 1} \\] 8.3.1 Calculation of aic.c in our setting In our case, we have \\(n\\) = 97 observations, and built a series of models with \\(k\\) = 2:9 predictors (including the intercept in each case), so we will insert those values into the general formula for bias-corrected AIC which is: aic.c &lt;- n * log( rs.summ$rss / n) + 2 * k + (2 * k * (k + 1) / (n - k - 1)) We can obtain the residual sum of squares explained by each model by pulling rss from the regsubsets summary contained here in rs.summ. data_frame(k = 2:9, RSS = rs.summ$rss) # A tibble: 8 x 2 k RSS &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 2 58.9 2 3 51.7 3 4 46.6 4 5 45.7 5 6 44.6 6 7 43.7 7 8 43.0 8 9 42.8 In this case, we have: rs.summ$aic.c &lt;- 97*log(rs.summ$rss / 97) + 2*(2:9) + (2 * (2:9) * ((2:9)+1) / (97 - (2:9) - 1)) round(rs.summ$aic.c,2) # bias-corrected [1] -44.24 -54.70 -62.74 -62.29 -62.34 -62.11 -61.17 -59.36 The impact of this bias correction can be modest but important. Here’s a little table looking closely at the results in this problem. The uncorrected AIC are obtained using extractAIC, as described in the next section. Size 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Bias-corrected AIC -44.2 -54.7 -62.7 -62.3 -62.3 -62.1 -61.2 -59.4 Uncorrected AIC -44.4 -55.0 -63.2 -62.4 -63.4 -63.0 -62.4 -61.4 8.3.2 The Uncorrected AIC provides no more useful information here We could, if necessary, also calculate the uncorrected AIC value for each model, but we won’t make any direct use of that, because that will not provide any new information not already gathered by the \\(C_p\\) statistic for a linear regression model. If you wanted to find the uncorrected AIC for a given model, you can use the extractAIC function. extractAIC(lm(lpsa ~ lcavol, data = prost)) [1] 2.00000 -44.36603 extractAIC(lm(lpsa ~ lcavol + lweight, data = prost)) [1] 3.00000 -54.95846 Note that: these results are fairly comparable to the bias-corrected AIC we built above, and the extractAIC and AIC functions look like they give very different results, but they really don’t. AIC(lm(lpsa ~ lcavol, data = prost)) [1] 232.908 AIC(lm(lpsa ~ lcavol + lweight, data = prost)) [1] 222.3156 But notice that the differences in AIC are the same, either way, comparing these two models: extractAIC(lm(lpsa ~ lcavol, data = prost)) - extractAIC(lm(lpsa ~ lcavol + lweight, data = prost)) [1] -1.00000 10.59243 AIC(lm(lpsa ~ lcavol, data = prost)) - AIC(lm(lpsa ~ lcavol + lweight, data = prost)) [1] 10.59243 AIC is only defined up to an additive constant. Since the difference between two models using either AIC or extractAIC is the same, this doesn’t actually matter which one we use, so long as we use the same one consistently. 8.3.3 Building a Tibble containing the necessary information Again, note the use of 2:9 for the values of \\(k\\), because we’re fitting one model for each size from 2 through 9. best_mods_1 &lt;- data_frame( k = 2:9, r2 = rs.summ$rsq, adjr2 = rs.summ$adjr2, cp = rs.summ$cp, aic.c = rs.summ$aic.c, bic = rs.summ$bic ) best_mods &lt;- cbind(best_mods_1, rs.summ$which) best_mods k r2 adjr2 cp aic.c bic (Intercept) lcavol 1 2 0.5394320 0.5345839 28.213914 -44.23838 -66.05416 TRUE TRUE 2 3 0.5955040 0.5868977 15.456669 -54.70040 -74.07188 TRUE TRUE 3 4 0.6359499 0.6242063 6.811986 -62.74265 -79.71614 TRUE TRUE 4 5 0.6425479 0.6270065 7.075509 -62.29223 -76.91557 TRUE TRUE 5 6 0.6509970 0.6318211 6.851826 -62.33858 -74.66120 TRUE TRUE 6 7 0.6584484 0.6356783 6.890739 -62.10692 -72.17992 TRUE TRUE 7 8 0.6634967 0.6370302 7.562119 -61.17338 -69.04961 TRUE TRUE 8 9 0.6656326 0.6352355 9.000000 -59.35841 -65.09253 TRUE TRUE lweight age bph_f svi_f lcp gleason_f pgg45 1 FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE 2 TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE 3 TRUE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE 4 TRUE FALSE TRUE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE 5 TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE 6 TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE 7 TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE FALSE 8 TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE 8.4 Plotting the Best Subsets Results using ggplot2 8.4.1 The Adjusted R2 Plot p1 &lt;- ggplot(best_mods, aes(x = k, y = adjr2, label = round(adjr2,2))) + geom_line() + geom_label() + geom_label(data = subset(best_mods, adjr2 == max(adjr2)), aes(x = k, y = adjr2, label = round(adjr2,2)), fill = &quot;yellow&quot;, col = &quot;blue&quot;) + theme_bw() + scale_x_continuous(breaks = 2:9) + labs(x = &quot;# of predictors (including intercept)&quot;, y = &quot;Adjusted R-squared&quot;) p1 Models 4-9 all look like reasonable choices here. The maximum adjusted R2 is seen in the model of size 8. 8.4.2 Mallows’ \\(C_p\\) The \\(C_p\\) statistic focuses directly on the tradeoff between bias (due to excluding important predictors from the model) and extra variance (due to including too many unimportant predictors in the model.) If N is the sample size, and we select \\(p\\) regression predictors from a set of \\(K\\) (where \\(p &lt; K\\)), then the \\(C_p\\) statistic is \\(C_p = \\frac{SSE_p}{MSE_K} - N + 2p\\) where: \\(SSE_p\\) is the sum of squares for error (residual) in the model with \\(p\\) predictors \\(MSE_K\\) is the residual mean square after regression in the model with all \\(K\\) predictors As it turns out, this is just measuring the particular model’s lack of fit, and then adding a penalty for the number of terms in the model (specifically \\(2p - N\\) is the penalty since the lack of fit is measured as \\((N-p) \\frac{SSE_p}{MSE_K}\\). If a model has no meaningful lack of fit (i.e. no substantial bias) then the expected value of \\(C_p\\) is roughly \\(p\\). Otherwise, the expectation is \\(p\\) plus a positive bias term. In general, we want to see smaller values of \\(C_p\\). We usually select a “winning model” by choosing a subset of predictors that have \\(C_p\\) near the value of \\(p\\). 8.4.3 The \\(C_p\\) Plot The \\(C_p\\) plot is just a scatterplot of \\(C_p\\) on the Y-axis, and the size of the model (coefficients plus intercept) \\(p = k\\) on the X-axis. Each of the various predictor subsets we will study is represented in a single point. A model without bias should have \\(C_p\\) roughly equal to \\(p\\), so we’ll frequently draw a line at \\(C_p = p\\) to make that clear. We then select our model from among all models with small \\(C_p\\) statistics. My typical approach is to identify the models where \\(C_p - p \\geq 0\\), then select from among those models the model where \\(C_p - p\\) is minimized, and if there is a tie, select the model where \\(p\\) is minimized. Another good candidate might be a slightly overfit model (where \\(C_p - p &lt; 0\\) but just barely.) p2 &lt;- ggplot(best_mods, aes(x = k, y = cp, label = round(cp,1))) + geom_line() + geom_label() + geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1, col = &quot;red&quot;) + theme_bw() + scale_x_continuous(breaks = 2:9) + labs(x = &quot;# of predictors (including intercept)&quot;, y = &quot;Mallows&#39; Cp&quot;) p2 Model 6 is a possibility here, with the difference \\(C_p - p\\) minimized among all models with \\(C_p &gt;= p\\). Model 7 also looks pretty good, with Cp just barely smaller than the size (p = 7) of the model. 8.4.4 “All Subsets” Regression and Information Criteria We might consider any of three main information criteria: the Bayesian Information Criterion, called BIC the Akaike Information Criterion (used by R’s default stepwise approaches,) called AIC a corrected version of AIC due to Hurvich and Tsai (1989), called AICc or aic.c Each of these indicates better models by getting smaller. Since the \\(C_p\\) and AIC results will lead to the same model, I’ll focus on plotting the bias-corrected AIC and on BIC. 8.4.5 The bias-corrected AIC plot p3 &lt;- ggplot(best_mods, aes(x = k, y = aic.c, label = round(aic.c,1))) + geom_line() + geom_label() + geom_label(data = subset(best_mods, aic.c == min(aic.c)), aes(x = k, y = aic.c), fill = &quot;pink&quot;, col = &quot;red&quot;) + theme_bw() + scale_x_continuous(breaks = 2:9) + labs(x = &quot;# of predictors (including intercept)&quot;, y = &quot;Bias-Corrected AIC&quot;) p3 The smallest AICc values occur in models 4 and later, especially model 4 itself. 8.4.6 The BIC plot p4 &lt;- ggplot(best_mods, aes(x = k, y = bic, label = round(bic,1))) + geom_line() + geom_label() + geom_label(data = subset(best_mods, bic == min(bic)), aes(x = k, y = bic), fill = &quot;lightgreen&quot;, col = &quot;blue&quot;) + theme_bw() + scale_x_continuous(breaks = 2:9) + labs(x = &quot;# of predictors (including intercept)&quot;, y = &quot;BIC&quot;) p4 8.4.7 All Four Plots in One Figure (via ggplot2) gridExtra::grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, p4, nrow = 2) 8.5 Table of Key Results We can build a big table, like this: best_mods k r2 adjr2 cp aic.c bic (Intercept) lcavol 1 2 0.5394320 0.5345839 28.213914 -44.23838 -66.05416 TRUE TRUE 2 3 0.5955040 0.5868977 15.456669 -54.70040 -74.07188 TRUE TRUE 3 4 0.6359499 0.6242063 6.811986 -62.74265 -79.71614 TRUE TRUE 4 5 0.6425479 0.6270065 7.075509 -62.29223 -76.91557 TRUE TRUE 5 6 0.6509970 0.6318211 6.851826 -62.33858 -74.66120 TRUE TRUE 6 7 0.6584484 0.6356783 6.890739 -62.10692 -72.17992 TRUE TRUE 7 8 0.6634967 0.6370302 7.562119 -61.17338 -69.04961 TRUE TRUE 8 9 0.6656326 0.6352355 9.000000 -59.35841 -65.09253 TRUE TRUE lweight age bph_f svi_f lcp gleason_f pgg45 1 FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE 2 TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE 3 TRUE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE 4 TRUE FALSE TRUE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE 5 TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE 6 TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE 7 TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE FALSE 8 TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE 8.6 Models Worth Considering? \\(k\\) Predictors Reason 4 lcavol lweight svi_f minimizes BIC, AICc 7 + age bph_f gleason_f \\(C_p\\) near p 8 + lcp max \\(R^2_{adj}\\) 8.7 Compare these candidate models in-sample? 8.7.1 Using anova to compare nested models Let’s run an ANOVA-based comparison of these nested models to each other and to the model with the intercept alone.

So there’s no significant decline in predictive value observed when we drop from the m.full model to the m08 model. This suggests that the m08 model may be a better choice. The second p value, of 0.2786, compares m08 to m07, and suggests that we lose no significant predictive value by dropping down to m07. The third p value, of 0.1050, compares m07 to m04, and suggests that we lose no significant predictive value by dropping down to m04. But the fourth p value, of 2e-16 (or, functionally, zero), compares m04 to m.int and suggests that we do gain significant predictive value by including the predictors in m04 as compared to a model with an intercept alone. So, by the significance tests, the model we’d select would be m04, but, of course, in-sample statistical significance alone isn’t a good enough reason to select a model if we want to do prediction well. 8.8 AIC and BIC comparisons, within the training sample Next, we’ll compare the three candidate models (ignoring the intercept-only and kitchen sink models) in terms of their AIC values and BIC values, again using the same sample we used to fit the models in the first place. AIC(m04, m07, m08) df AIC m04 5 214.0966 m07 10 214.2327 m08 11 214.9148 BIC(m04, m07, m08) df BIC m04 5 226.9702 m07 10 239.9798 m08 11 243.2366 The model with the smallest AIC value shows the best performance within the sample on that measure. Similarly, smaller BIC values are associated with predictor sets that perform better in sample on that criterion. BIC often suggests smaller models (with fewer regression inputs) than does AIC. Does that happen in this case? Note that AIC and BIC can be calculated in a few different ways, so we may see some variation if we don’t compare apples to apples with regard to the R functions involved. 8.9 Cross-Validation of Candidate Models out of Sample 8.9.1 20-fold Cross-Validation of model m04 Model m04 uses lcavol, lweight and svi_f to predict the lpsa outcome. Let’s do 20-fold cross-validation of this modeling approach, and calculate the root mean squared prediction error and the mean absolute prediction error for that modeling scheme. set.seed(43201) cv_m04 &lt;- prost %&gt;% crossv_kfold(k = 20) %&gt;% mutate(model = map(train, ~ lm(lpsa ~ lcavol + lweight + svi_f, data = .))) cv_m04_pred &lt;- cv_m04 %&gt;% unnest(map2(model, test, ~ augment(.x, newdata = .y))) cv_m04_results &lt;- cv_m04_pred %&gt;% summarize(Model = &quot;m04&quot;, RMSE = sqrt(mean((lpsa - .fitted) ^2)), MAE = mean(abs(lpsa - .fitted))) cv_m04_results # A tibble: 1 x 3 Model RMSE MAE &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 m04 0.725 0.574 8.9.2 20-fold Cross-Validation of model m07 Model m07 uses lcavol, lweight, svi_f, age, bph_f, and gleason_f to predict the lpsa outcome. Let’s now do 20-fold cross-validation of this modeling approach, and calculate the root mean squared prediction error and the mean absolute prediction error for that modeling scheme. Note the small changes required, as compared to our cross-validation of model m04 a moment ago. set.seed(43202) cv_m07 &lt;- prost %&gt;% crossv_kfold(k = 20) %&gt;% mutate(model = map(train, ~ lm(lpsa ~ lcavol + lweight + svi_f + age + bph_f + gleason_f, data = .))) cv_m07_pred &lt;- cv_m07 %&gt;% unnest(map2(model, test, ~ augment(.x, newdata = .y))) cv_m07_results &lt;- cv_m07_pred %&gt;% summarize(Model = &quot;m07&quot;, RMSE = sqrt(mean((lpsa - .fitted) ^2)), MAE = mean(abs(lpsa - .fitted))) cv_m07_results # A tibble: 1 x 3 Model RMSE MAE &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 m07 0.730 0.556 8.9.3 20-fold Cross-Validation of model m08 Model m08 uses lcavol, lweight, svi_f, age, bph_f, gleason_f and lcp to predict the lpsa outcome. Let’s now do 20-fold cross-validation of this modeling approach. set.seed(43202) cv_m08 &lt;- prost %&gt;% crossv_kfold(k = 20) %&gt;% mutate(model = map(train, ~ lm(lpsa ~ lcavol + lweight + svi_f + age + bph_f + gleason_f + lcp, data = .))) cv_m08_pred &lt;- cv_m08 %&gt;% unnest(map2(model, test, ~ augment(.x, newdata = .y))) cv_m08_results &lt;- cv_m08_pred %&gt;% summarize(Model = &quot;m08&quot;, RMSE = sqrt(mean((lpsa - .fitted) ^2)), MAE = mean(abs(lpsa - .fitted))) cv_m08_results # A tibble: 1 x 3 Model RMSE MAE &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 m08 0.729 0.557 8.9.4 Comparing the Results of the Cross-Validations bind_rows(cv_m04_results, cv_m07_results, cv_m08_results) # A tibble: 3 x 3 Model RMSE MAE &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 m04 0.725 0.574 2 m07 0.730 0.556 3 m08 0.729 0.557 It appears that model m04 has the smallest RMSE and MAE in this case. So, that’s the model with the strongest cross-validated predictive accuracy, by these two standards. 8.10 What about Interaction Terms? Suppose we consider for a moment a much smaller and less realistic problem. We want to use best subsets to identify a model out of a set of three predictors for lpsa: specifically lcavol, age and svi_f, but now we also want to consider the interaction of svi_f with lcavol as a potential addition. Remember that svi is the 1/0 numeric version of svi_f. We could simply add a numerical product term to our model, as follows. pred2 &lt;- with(prost, cbind(lcavol, age, svi_f, svixlcavol = svi*lcavol)) rs.ks2 &lt;- regsubsets(pred2, y = prost$lpsa, nvmax = NULL, nbest = 1) rs.summ2 &lt;- summary(rs.ks2) rs.summ2 Subset selection object 4 Variables (and intercept) Forced in Forced out lcavol FALSE FALSE age FALSE FALSE svi_f FALSE FALSE svixlcavol FALSE FALSE 1 subsets of each size up to 4 Selection Algorithm: exhaustive lcavol age svi_f svixlcavol 1 ( 1 ) &quot;*&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2 ( 1 ) &quot;*&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;*&quot; &quot; &quot; 3 ( 1 ) &quot;*&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;*&quot; &quot;*&quot; 4 ( 1 ) &quot;*&quot; &quot;*&quot; &quot;*&quot; &quot;*&quot; In this case, best subsets doesn’t identify the interaction term as an attractive predictor until it has already included the main effects that go into it. So that’s fine. But if that isn’t the case, we would have a problem. To resolve this, we could: Consider interactions beforehand, and force them in if desired. Consider interaction terms outside of best subsets, and only after the selection of main effects. Use another approach to deal with variable selection for interaction terms. References "],

I’ll include both a linear model (in blue) and a loess smooth (in red.) Does the relationship appear to be linear? ggplot(pollution, aes(x = x2, y = y)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, col = &quot;blue&quot;, se = F) + geom_smooth(method = &quot;loess&quot;, col = &quot;red&quot;, se = F) Suppose we plot the residuals that emerge from the linear model shown in blue, above. Do we see a curve in a plot of residuals against fitted values? plot(lm(y ~ x2, data = pollution), which = 1) 9.3 Quadratic polynomial model to predict y using x2 A polynomial in the variable x of degree D is a linear combination of the powers of x up to D. For example: Linear: \\(y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x\\) Quadratic: \\(y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + \\beta_2 x^2\\) Cubic: \\(y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + \\beta_2 x^2 + \\beta_3 x^3\\) Quartic: \\(y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + \\beta_2 x^2 + \\beta_3 x^3 + \\beta_4 x^4\\) Quintic: \\(y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + \\beta_2 x^2 + \\beta_3 x^3 + \\beta_4 x^4 + \\beta_5 x^5\\) Fitting such a model creates a **polynomial regression*. 9.3.1 The raw quadratic model Let’s look at a quadratic model which predicts y using x2 and the square of x2, so that our model is of the form: \\[ y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_2 + \\beta_2 x_2^2 + error \\] There are several ways to fit this exact model. One approach is to calculate the square of x2 within our pollution data set, and then feed both x2 and x2squared to lm. Another approach uses the I function within our lm to specify the use of both x2 and its square. Yet another approach uses the poly function within our lm, which can be used to specify raw models including x2 and x2squared. pollution &lt;- pollution %&gt;% mutate(x2squared = x2^2) mod2a &lt;- lm(y ~ x2 + x2squared, data = pollution) mod2b &lt;- lm(y ~ x2 + I(x2^2), data = pollution) mod2c &lt;- lm(y ~ poly(x2, degree = 2, raw = TRUE), data = pollution) Each of these approaches produces the same model, as they are just different ways of expressing the same idea. summary(mod2a) Call: lm(formula = y ~ x2 + x2squared, data = pollution) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -148.977 -38.651 6.889 35.312 189.346 Coefficients: Estimate Std.

By default, with raw = FALSE, the poly() function within a linear model computes what is called an orthogonal polynomial. An orthogonal polynomial sets up a model design matrix using the coding we’ve seen previously: x2 and x2^2 in our case, and then scales those columns so that each column is orthogonal to the previous ones. This eliminates the collinearity (correlation between predictors) and lets our t tests tell us whether the addition of any particular polynomial term improves the fit of the model over the lower orders. Would the addition of a cubic term help us much in predicting y from x2? mod3 &lt;- lm(y ~ poly(x2, 3), data = pollution) summary(mod3) Call: lm(formula = y ~ poly(x2, 3), data = pollution) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -146.262 -39.679 5.569 35.984 191.536 Coefficients: Estimate Std.

A restricted cubic spline is a way to build highly complicated curves into a regression equation in a fairly easily structured way. A restricted cubic spline is a series of polynomial functions joined together at the knots. Such a spline gives us a way to flexibly account for non-linearity without over-fitting the model. Restricted cubic splines can fit many different types of non-linearities. Specifying the number of knots is all you need to do in R to get a reasonable result from a restricted cubic spline. The most common choices are 3, 4, or 5 knots. Each additional knot adds to the non-linearity, and spends an additional degree of freedom: 3 Knots, 2 degrees of freedom, allows the curve to “bend” once. 4 Knots, 3 degrees of freedom, lets the curve “bend” twice. 5 Knots, 4 degrees of freedom, lets the curve “bend” three times. For most applications, three to five knots strike a nice balance between complicating the model needlessly and fitting data pleasingly. Let’s consider a restricted cubic spline model for our y based on x3 again, but now with: in mod5a, 3 knots, in mod5b, 4 knots, and in mod5c, 5 knots mod5a_rcs &lt;- lm(y ~ rcs(x3, 3), data = pollution) mod5b_rcs &lt;- lm(y ~ rcs(x3, 4), data = pollution) mod5c_rcs &lt;- lm(y ~ rcs(x3, 5), data = pollution) Here, for instance, is the summary of the 5-knot model: summary(mod5c_rcs) Call: lm(formula = y ~ rcs(x3, 5), data = pollution) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -141.522 -32.009 1.674 31.971 147.878 Coefficients: Estimate Std.

There are two kinds of Multivariate Regression Models [Prediction] Those that are built so that we can make accurate predictions. [Explanatory] Those that are built to help understand underlying phenomena. While those two notions overlap considerably, they do imply different things about how we strategize about model-building and model assessment. Harrell’s primary concern is effective use of the available data for prediction - this implies some things that will be different from what we’ve seen in the past. Harrell refers to multivariable regression modeling strategy as the process of spending degrees of freedom. The main job in strategizing about multivariate modeling is to Decide the number of degrees of freedom that can be spent Decide where to spend them Spend them, wisely. What this means is essentially linked to making decisions about predictor complexity, both in terms of how many predictors will be included in the regression model, and about how we’ll include those predictors. 9.7 “Spending” Degrees of Freedom “Spending” df includes fitting parameter estimates in models, or examining figures built using the outcome variable Y that tell you how to model the predictors. If you use a scatterplot of Y vs. X or the residuals of the Y-X regression model vs. X to decide whether a linear model is appropriate, then how many degrees of freedom have you actually spent? Grambsch and O’Brien conclude that if you wish to preserve the key statistical properties of the various estimation and fitting procedures used in building a model, you can’t retrieve these degrees of freedom once they have been spent. 9.7.1 Overfitting and Limits on the # of Predictors Suppose you have a total sample size of \\(n\\) observations, then you really shouldn’t be thinking about estimating more than \\(n / 15\\) regression coefficients, at the most. If \\(k\\) is the number of parameters in a full model containing all candidate predictors for a stepwise analysis, then \\(k\\) should be no greater than \\(n / 15\\). \\(k\\) should include all variables screened for association with the response, including interaction terms. So if you have 97 observations in your data, then you can probably just barely justify the use of a stepwise analysis using the main effects alone of 5 candidate variables (with one additional DF for the intercept term.) Harrell (2001) also mentions that if you have a narrowly distributed predictor, without a lot of variation to work with, then an even larger sample size \\(n\\) should be required. See Vittinghoff et al. (2012), Section 10.3 for more details. 9.7.2 The Importance of Collinearity Collinearity denotes correlation between predictors high enough to degrade the precision of the regression coefficient estimates substantially for some or all of the correlated predictors Vittinghoff et al. (2012), section 10.4.1 Can one predictor in a model be predicted well using the other predictors in the model? Strong correlations (for instance, \\(r \\geq 0.8\\)) are especially troublesome. Effects of collinearity decreases precision, in the sense of increasing the standard errors of the parameter estimates decreases power increases the difficulty of interpreting individual predictor effects overall F test is significant, but individual t tests may not be Suppose we want to assess whether variable \\(X_j\\) is collinear with the other predictors in a model. We run a regression predicting \\(X_j\\) using the other predictors, and obtain the R2. The VIF is defined as 1 / (1 - this R2), and we usually interpret VIFs above 5 as indicating a serious multicollinearity problem (i.e. R2 values for this predictor of 0.8 and above would thus concern us.) vif(lm(y ~ x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5 + x6, data = pollution)) x1 x2 x3 x4 x5 x6 2.238862 2.058731 2.153044 4.174448 3.447399 1.792996 Occasionally, you’ll see the inverse of VIF reported, and this is called tolerance. tolerance = 1 / VIF 9.7.3 Collinearity in an Explanatory Model When we are attempting to identify multiple independent predictors (the explanatory model approach), then we will need to choose between collinear variables options suggested by Vittinghoff et al. (2012), p. 422, include choosing on the basis of plausibility as a causal factor, choosing the variable that has higher data quality (is measured more accurately or has fewer missing values.) Often, we choose to include a variable that is statistically significant as a predictor, and drop others, should we be so lucky. Larger effects, especially if they are associated with predictors that have minimal correlation with the other predictors under study, cause less trouble in terms of potential violation of the \\(n/15\\) rule for what constitutes a reasonable number of predictors. 9.7.4 Collinearity in a Prediction Model If we are primarily building a prediction model for which inference on the individual predictors is not of interest, then it is totally reasonable to use both predictors in the model, if doing so reduces prediction error. Collinearity doesn’t affect predictions in our model development sample. Collinearity doesn’t affect predictions on new data so long as the new data have similar relationships between predictors. If our key predictor is correlated strongly with a confounder, then if the predictor remains significant after adjustment for the confounder, then this suggests a meaningful independent effect. If the effects of the predictor are clearly confounded by the adjustment variable, we again have a clear result. If neither is statistically significant after adjustment, the data may be inadequate. If the collinearity is between adjustment variables, but doesn’t involve the key predictor, then inclusion of the collinear variables is unlikely to cause substantial problems. 9.8 Spending DF on Non-Linearity: The Spearman \\(\\rho^2\\) Plot We need a flexible approach to assessing non-linearity and fitting models with non-linear predictors. This will lead us to a measure of what Harrell (2001) calls potential predictive punch which hides the true form of the regression from the analyst so as to preserve statistical properties, but that lets us make sensible decisions about whether a predictor should be included in a model, and the number of parameters (degrees of freedom, essentially) we are willing to devote to it. What if we want to consider where best to spend our degrees of freedom on non-linear predictor terms, like interactions, polynomial functions or curved splines to represent our input data? The approach we’ll find useful in the largest variety of settings is a combination of a rank correlation assessment of potential predictive punch (using a Spearman \\(\\rho^2\\) plot, available in the Hmisc package), followed by the application of restricted cubic splines to fit and assess models. Suppose, for instance, that we want to create a model for y using some combination of linear and non-linear terms drawn from the complete set of 15 predictors available in the pollution data. I’d begin by running a Spearman \\(\\rho^2\\) plot: plot(Hmisc::spearman2(y ~ x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5 + x6 + x7 + x8 + x9 + x10 + x11 + x12 + x13 + x14 + x15, data = pollution)) The variable with the largest adjusted squared Spearman \\(\\rho\\) statistic in this setting is x9, followed by x6 and x14. With only 60 observations, we might well want to restrict ourselves to a very small model. What the Spearman plot suggests is that we focus any non-linear terms on x9 first, and then perhaps x6 and x14 as they have some potential predictive power. It may or may not work out that the non-linear terms are productive. 9.8.1 Fitting a Big Model to the pollution data So, one possible model built in reaction this plot might be to fit: a restricted cubic spline with 5 knots on x9 a restricted cubic spline with 3 knots on x6 and a quadratic polynomial on x14 plus a linear fit to x1 and x13 That’s way more degrees of freedom (4 for x9, 2 for x6, 2 for x14 and 1 each for x1 and x13 makes a total of 10 without the intercept term) than we can really justify with a sample of 60 observations. But let’s see what happens. mod_big &lt;- lm(y ~ rcs(x9, 5) + rcs(x6, 3) + poly(x14, 2) + x1 + x13, data = pollution) anova(mod_big) Analysis of Variance Table Response: y Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) rcs(x9, 5) 4 100164 25040.9 17.8482 4.229e-09 *** rcs(x6, 3) 2 38306 19152.8 13.6513 1.939e-05 *** poly(x14, 2) 2 15595 7797.7 5.5579 0.006677 ** x1 1 4787 4787.3 3.4122 0.070759 . x13 1 712 711.9 0.5074 0.479635 Residuals 49 68747 1403.0 --- Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 This anova suggests that we have at least some predictive value in each spline (x9 and x6) and some additional value in x14, although it’s not as clear that the linear terms (x1 and x13) did much good. 9.8.2 Limitations of lm for fitting complex linear regression models We can certainly assess this big, complex model using lm in comparison to other models: with in-sample summary statistics like adjusted R2, AIC and BIC, we can assess its assumptions with residual plots, and we can also compare out-of-sample predictive quality through cross-validation, But to really delve into the details of how well this complex model works, and to help plot what is actually being fit, we’ll probably want to fit the model using an alternative method for fitting linear models, called ols, from the rms package developed by Frank Harrell and colleagues. That will be the focus of our next chapter. References "],

Now, instead of using lm to fit this model, we’ll use a new function called ols from the rms package developed by Frank Harrell and colleagues, in part to support ideas developed in Harrell (2001) for clinical prediction models. 10.1 Fitting a model with ols We will use the datadist approach when fitting a linear model with ols from the rms package, so as to store additional important elements of the model fit. library(rms) d &lt;- datadist(pollution) options(datadist = &quot;d&quot;) Next, we’ll fit the model using ols and place its results in newmod. newmod &lt;- ols(y ~ rcs(x9, 5) + rcs(x6, 3) + pol(x14, 2) + x1 + x13, data = pollution, x = TRUE, y = TRUE) newmod Linear Regression Model ols(formula = y ~ rcs(x9, 5) + rcs(x6, 3) + pol(x14, 2) + x1 + x13, data = pollution, x = TRUE, y = TRUE) Model Likelihood Discrimination Ratio Test Indexes Obs 60 LR chi2 72.02 R2 0.699 sigma37.4566 d.f. 10 R2 adj 0.637 d.f. 49 Pr(&gt; chi2) 0.0000 g 58.961 Residuals Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -86.189 -18.554 -1.799 18.645 104.307 Coef S.E. t Pr(&gt;|t|) Intercept 796.2658 162.3269 4.91 &lt;0.0001 x9 -2.6328 6.3504 -0.41 0.6803 x9&#39; 121.4651 124.4827 0.98 0.3340 x9&#39;&#39; -219.8025 227.6775 -0.97 0.3391 x9&#39;&#39;&#39; 151.5700 171.3867 0.88 0.3808 x6 7.6817 15.5230 0.49 0.6229 x6&#39; -29.4388 18.0531 -1.63 0.1094 x14 0.5652 0.2547 2.22 0.0311 x14^2 -0.0010 0.0010 -0.96 0.3407 x1 1.0717 0.7317 1.46 0.1494 x13 -0.1028 0.1443 -0.71 0.4796 Some of the advantages and disadvantages of fitting linear regression models with ols or lm will reveal themselves over time. For now, one advantage for ols is that the entire variance-covariance matrix is saved. Most of the time, there will be some value to considering both ols and lm approaches. Most of this output should be familiar, but a few pieces are different. 10.1.1 The Model Likelihood Ratio Test The Model Likelihood Ratio Test compares newmod to the null model with only an intercept term. It is a goodness-of-fit test that we’ll use in several types of model settings this semester. In many settings, the logarithm of the likelihood ratio, multiplied by -2, yields a value which can be compared to a \\(\\chi^2\\) distribution. So here, the value 72.02 is -2(log likelihood), and is compared to a \\(\\chi^2\\) distribution with 10 degrees of freedom. We reject the null hypothesis that newmod is no better than the null model, and conclude instead that at least one of these predictors adds statistically significant value. For ols, interpret the model likelihood ratio test like the global (ANOVA) F test in lm. The likelihood function is the probability of observing our data under the specified model. We can compare two nested models by evaluating the difference in their likelihood ratios and degrees of freedom, then comparing the result to a \\(\\chi^2\\) distribution. 10.1.2 The g statistic The g statistic is new and is referred to as the g-index. it’s based on Gini’s mean difference and is purported to be a robust and highly efficient measure of variation. Here, g = 58.9, which implies that if you randomly select two of the 60 areas included in the model, the average difference in predicted y (Age-Adjusted Mortality Rate) using this model will be 58.9. Technically, g is Gini’s mean difference of the predicted values. 10.2 ANOVA for an ols model One advantage of the ols approach is that when you apply an anova to it, it separates out the linear and non-linear components of restricted cubic splines and polynomial terms (as well as product terms, if your model includes them.) anova(newmod) Analysis of Variance Response: y Factor d.f.

In essence, the partial sums of squares and F tests here describe the marginal impact of removing each covariate from newmod. We conclude that the non-linear parts of x9 and x6 and x14 combined don’t seem to add much value, but that overall, x9, x6 and x14 seem to be valuable. So it must be the linear parts of those variables within our model that are doing the lion’s share of the work. 10.3 Effect Estimates A particularly useful thing to get out of the ols approach that is not as easily available in lm (without recoding or standardizing our predictors) is a summary of the effects of each predictor in an interesting scale. summary(newmod) Effects Response : y Factor Low High Diff. Effect S.E. Lower 0.95 Upper 0.95 x9 4.95 15.65 10.70 40.4060 14.0790 12.1120 68.6990 x6 10.40 11.50 1.10 -18.2930 8.1499 -34.6710 -1.9153 x14 11.00 69.00 58.00 28.3480 10.6480 6.9503 49.7460 x1 32.75 43.25 10.50 11.2520 7.6833 -4.1878 26.6930 x13 4.00 23.75 19.75 -2.0303 2.8502 -7.7579 3.6973 This “effects summary” shows the effect on y of moving from the 25th to the 75th percentile of each variable (along with a standard error and 95% confidence interval) while holding the other variable at the level specified at the bottom of the output. The most useful way to look at this sort of analysis is often a plot. plot(summary(newmod)) For x9 note from the summary above that the 25th percentile is 4.95 and the 75th is 15.65. Our conclusion is that the estimated effect of moving x9 from 4.95 to 15.65 is an increase of 40.4 on y, with a 95% CI of (12.1, 68.7). For a categorical variable, the low level is shown first and then the high level. The plot shows the point estimate (arrow head) and then the 90% (narrowest bar), 95% (middle bar) and 99% (widest bar in lightest color) confidence intervals for each predictor’s effect. It’s easier to distinguish this in the x9 plot than the one for x13. Remember that what is being compared is the first value to the second value’s impact on the outcome, with other predictors held constant. 10.3.1 Simultaneous Confidence Intervals These confidence intervals make no effort to deal with the multiple comparisons problem, but just fit individual 95% (or whatever level you choose) confidence intervals for each predictor. The natural alternative is to make an adjustment for multiple comparisons in fitting the confidence intervals, so that the set of (in this case, five - one for each predictor) confidence intervals for effect sizes has a family-wise 95% confidence level. You’ll note that the effect estimates and standard errors are unchanged from those shown above, but the confidence limits are a bit wider. summary(newmod, conf.type=c(&#39;simultaneous&#39;)) Effects Response : y Factor Low High Diff.

Note that each panel shows point and interval estimates of the effects, and spot the straight lines in x1 and x13, the single bends in x14 and x6 and the wiggles in x9, corresponding to the amount of non-linearity specified in the model. ggplot(Predict(newmod)) 10.5 Checking Influence via dfbeta For an ols object, we have several tools for looking at residuals. The most interesting to me is which.influence which is reliant on the notion of dfbeta. DFBETA is estimated for each observation in the data, and each coefficient in the model. The DFBETA is the difference in the estimated coefficient caused by deleting the observation, scaled by the coefficient’s standard error estimated with the observation deleted. The which.influence command applied to an ols model produces a list of all of the predictors estimated by the model, including the intercept. For each predictor, the command lists all observations (by row number) that, if removed from the model, would cause the estimated coefficient (the “beta”) for that predictor to change by at least some particular cutoff. The default is that the DFBETA for that predictor is 0.2 or more. which.influence(newmod) $Intercept [1] 2 11 28 32 37 49 59 $x9 [1] 2 3 6 9 31 35 49 57 58 $x6 [1] 2 11 15 28 32 37 50 56 59 $x14 [1] 2 6 7 12 13 16 32 37 $x1 [1] 7 18 32 37 49 57 $x13 [1] 29 32 37 The implication here, for instance, is that if we drop row 3 from our data frame, and refit the model, this will have a meaningful impact on the estimate of x9 but not on the other coefficients. But if we drop, say, row 37, we will affect the estimates of the intercept, x6, x14, x1, and x13. 10.5.1 Using the residuals command for dfbetas To see the dfbeta values, standardized according to the approach I used above, you can use the following code (I’ll use head to just show the first few rows of results) to get a matrix of the results. head(residuals(newmod, type = &quot;dfbetas&quot;)) [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [1,] 0.03071160 -0.023775487 -0.004055111 0.01205425 -0.03260003 [2,] -0.38276573 -0.048404993 -0.142293606 0.17009666 -0.22350621 [3,] 0.17226780 -0.426153536 0.350913139 -0.32949129 0.25777913 [4,] 0.06175110 -0.006460916 0.024828272 -0.03009337 0.04154812 [5,] 0.16875200 0.039839994 -0.058178534 0.06449504 -0.07772208 [6,] 0.03322073 0.112699877 -0.203543632 0.23987378 -0.35201736 [,6] [,7] [,8] [,9] [,10] [1,] -0.02392315 0.01175375 -0.06494414 0.060929683 -0.011042644 [2,] 0.44737372 -0.48562818 0.19372285 -0.212186731 -0.107830147 [3,] -0.10263448 0.05005284 -0.02049877 0.014059330 0.010793169 [4,] -0.06254145 0.05498432 0.01135031 -0.001877983 -0.005490454 [5,] -0.18058630 0.16151742 0.02723710 0.065483158 0.003326357 [6,] -0.04075617 0.02900006 -0.21508009 0.171627718 0.019241676 [,11] [1,] 0.03425156 [2,] -0.01503250 [3,] 0.04924166 [4,] -0.01254111 [5,] -0.05570035 [6,] 0.05775536 10.5.2 Using the residuals command for other summaries The residuals command will also let you get ordinary residuals, leverage values and dffits values, which are the normalized differences in predicted values when observations are omitted.

At the final project presentations, I mentioned (to many folks) that there was a way to automate this process a bit in 432, that would provide some ways to get the machine to split the data for you multiple times, and then average over the results, using a bootstrap approach. This is it. The validate function allows us to perform cross-validation of our models for some summary statistics (and then correct those statistics for optimism in describing likely predictive accuracy) in an easy way. validate develops: Resampling validation with or without backward elimination of variables Estimates of the optimism in measures of predictive accuracy Estimates of the intercept and slope of a calibration model with the following code… set.seed(432002); validate(newmod, method = &quot;boot&quot;, B = 40) index.orig training test optimism index.corrected n R-square 0.6989 0.7500 0.5964 0.1536 0.5452 40 MSE 1145.7800 888.2564 1535.8277 -647.5714 1793.3514 40 g 58.9614 58.9323 55.2085 3.7238 55.2376 40 Intercept 0.0000 0.0000 86.5968 -86.5968 86.5968 40 Slope 1.0000 1.0000 0.9088 0.0912 0.9088 40 So, for R-square we see that our original estimate was 0.6989 Our estimated R-square across n = 40 training samples was 0.7500, but in the resulting tests, the average R-square was only 0.5964 This suggests an optimism of 0.7500 - 0.5964 = 0.1536 (after rounding). We then apply that optimism to obtain a new estimate of R2 corrected for overfitting, at 0.5452, which is probably a better estimate of what our results might look like in new data that were similar to (but not the same as) the data we used in building newmod than our initial estimate of 0.6989 We also obtain optimism-corrected estimates of the mean squared error (square of the residual standard deviation), the g index, and the intercept and slope of the calibration model. The “corrected” slope is a shrinkage factor that takes overfitting into account. 10.7 Building a Nomogram for Our Model Another nice feature of an ols model object is that we can picture the model with a nomogram easily. Here is model newmod. plot(nomogram(newmod)) For this model, we can use this plot to predict y as follows: find our values of x9 on the appropriate line draw a vertical line up to the points line to count the points associated with our subject repeat the process to obtain the points associated with x6, x14, x1, and x13. Sum the points. draw a vertical line down from that number in the Total Points line to estimate y (the Linear Predictor) = Age-Adjusted Mortality Rate. The impact of the non-linearity is seen in the x6 results, for example, which turn around from 9-10 to 11-12. We also see non-linearity’s effects in the scales of the non-linear terms in terms of points awarded. An area with a combination of predictor values leading to a total of 100 points, for instance, would lead to a prediction of a Mortality Rate near 905. An area with a total of 140 points would have a predicted Mortality Rate of 955, roughly. References "],

The R2 for a model selected in a stepwise manner is biased, high. The coefficient estimates and standard errors are biased. The \\(p\\) values for the individual-variable t tests are too small. In stepwise analyses of prediction models, the final model represented noise 20-74% of the time. In stepwise analyses, the final model usually contained less than half of the actual number of real predictors. It is not logical that a population regression coefficient would be exactly zero just because its estimate was not statistically significant. This last comment applies to things like our “best subsets” approach as well as standard stepwise procedures. Sander Greenland’s comments on parsimony and stepwise approaches to model selection are worth addressing… Stepwise variable selection on confounders leaves important confounders uncontrolled. Shrinkage approaches (like ridge regression and the lasso) are far superior to variable selection. Variable selection does more damage to confidence interval widths than to point estimates. If we are seriously concerned about overfitting - winding up with a model that doesn’t perform well on new data - then stepwise approaches generally don’t help. Vittinghoff et al. (2012) suggest four strategies for minimizing the chance of overfitting Pre-specify well-motivated predictors and how to model them. Eliminate predictors without using the outcome. Use the outcome, but cross-validate the target measure of prediction error. Use the outcome, and shrink the coefficient estimates. The best subsets methods we have studied either include a variable or drop it from the model. Often, this choice is based on only a tiny difference in the quality of a fit to data. Harrell (2001): not reasonable to assume that a population regression coefficient would be exactly zero just because it failed to meet a criterion for significance. Brad Efron has suggested that a stepwise approach is “overly greedy, impulsively eliminating covariates which are correlated with other covariates.” So, what’s the alternative? 11.2 Ridge Regression Ridge regression involves a more smooth transition between useful and not useful predictors which can be obtained by constraining the overall size of the regression coefficients. Ridge regression assumes that the regression coefficients (after normalization) should not be very large. This is reasonable to assume when you have lots of predictors and you believe many of them have some effect on the outcome. Pros: Some nice statistical properties Can be calculated using only standard least squares approaches, so it’s been around for a while. Available in the MASS package. Ridge regression takes the sum of the squared estimated standardized regression coefficients and constrains that sum to only be as large as some value \\(k\\). \\[ \\sum \\hat{\\beta_j}^2 \\leq k. \\] The value \\(k\\) is one of several available measures of the amount of shrinkage, but the main one used in the MASS package is a value \\(\\lambda\\). As \\(\\lambda\\) increases, the amount of shrinkage goes up, and \\(k\\) goes down. 11.2.1 Assessing a Ridge Regression Approach We’ll look at a plot produced by the lm.ridge function for a ridge regression for the prostate cancer study we worked on when studying Stepwise Regression and Best Subsets methods earlier. Several (here 101) different values for \\(\\lambda\\), our shrinkage parameter, will be tested. Results are plotted so that we see the coefficients across the various (standardized) predictors. Each selection of a \\(\\lambda\\) value implies a different vector of covariate values across the predictors we are studying. The idea is to pick a value of \\(\\lambda\\) for which the coefficients seem relatively stable. preds &lt;- with(prost, cbind(lcavol, lweight, age, bph_f, svi_f, lcp, gleason_f, pgg45)) x &lt;- lm.ridge(prost$lpsa ~ preds, lambda = 0:100) plot(x) title(&quot;Ridge Regression for prost data&quot;) abline(h = 0) Usually, you need to use trial and error to decide the range of \\(\\lambda\\) to be tested. Here, 0:100 means going from 0 (no shrinkage) to 100 in steps of 1. 11.2.2 The lm.ridge plot - where do coefficients stabilize? Does \\(\\lambda = 20\\) seem like a stable spot here? x &lt;- lm.ridge(prost$lpsa ~ preds, lambda = 0:100) plot(x) title(&quot;Ridge Regression for prost data&quot;) abline(h = 0) abline(v=20, lty=2, col=&quot;black&quot;) The coefficients at \\(\\lambda\\) = 20 can be determined from the lm.ridge output. These are fully standardized coefficients. The original predictors are centered by their means and then scaled by their standard deviations and the outcome has also been centered, in these models. round(x$coef[,20],3) predslcavol predslweight predsage predsbph_f predssvi_f 0.482 0.248 -0.091 0.097 0.252 predslcp predsgleason_f predspgg45 0.009 -0.099 0.061 Was an intercept used? x$Inter [1] 1 Yes, it was.

It’s been easy to do ridge regression for many years, so you see it occasionally in the literature. It leads to the lasso, which incorporates the positive features of shrinking regression coefficients with the ability to wisely select some variables to be eliminated from the predictor pool. 11.3 The Lasso The lasso works by takes the sum of the absolute values of the estimated standardized regression coefficients and constrains it to only be as large as some value k. \\[ \\sum \\hat{|\\beta_j|} \\leq k. \\] This looks like a minor change, but it’s not. 11.3.1 Consequences of the Lasso Approach In ridge regression, while the individual coefficients shrink and sometimes approach zero, they seldom reach zero and are thus excluded from the model. With the lasso, some coefficients do reach zero and thus, those predictors do drop out of the model. So the lasso leads to more parsimonious models than does ridge regression. Ridge regression is a method of shrinkage but not model selection. The lasso accomplishes both tasks. If k is chosen to be too small, then the model may not capture important characteristics of the data. If k is too large, the model may over-fit the data in the sample and thus not represent the population of interest accurately. The lasso is far more difficult computationally than ridge regression (the problem requires an algorithm called least angle regression published in 2004), although R has a library (lars) which can do the calculations pretty efficiently. The lasso is not an acronym, but rather refers to cowboys using a rope to pull cattle from the herd, much as we will pull predictors from a model. 11.3.2 How The Lasso Works The lars package lets us compute the lasso coefficient estimates and do cross-validation to determine the appropriate amount of shrinkage. The main tool is a pair of graphs. The first plot shows what coefficients get selected as we move from constraining all of the coefficients to zero (complete shrinkage) towards fewer constraints all the way up to ordinary least squares, showing which variables are included in the model at each point. The second plot suggests where on the first plot we should look for a good model choice, according to a cross-validation approach. ## requires lars package lasso1 &lt;- lars(preds, prost$lpsa, type=&quot;lasso&quot;) plot(lasso1) The y axis shows standardized regression coefficients. The lars package standardizes all variables so the shrinkage doesn’t penalize some coefficients because of their scale. The x-axis is labeled |beta|/max|beta|. This ranges from 0 to 1. 0 means that the sum of the \\(|\\hat{\\beta_j}|\\) is zero (completely shrunk) 1 means the ordinary least squares unbiased estimates. The lasso graph starts at constraining all of the coefficients to zero, and then moves toward ordinary least squares. Identifiers for the predictors (numbers) are shown to the right of the graph. The vertical lines in the lasso plot show when a variable has been eliminated from the model, and in fact these are the only points that are actually shown in the default lasso graph. The labels on the top of the graph tell you how many predictors are in the model at that stage. summary(lasso1) LARS/LASSO Call: lars(x = preds, y = prost$lpsa, type = &quot;lasso&quot;) Df Rss Cp 0 1 127.918 168.1835 1 2 76.392 64.1722 2 3 70.247 53.5293 3 4 50.598 15.1017 4 5 49.065 13.9485 5 6 48.550 14.8898 6 7 46.284 12.2276 7 8 44.002 9.5308 8 9 42.772 9.0000 Based on the Cp statistics, it looks like the improvements continue throughout, and don’t really finish happening until we get pretty close to the full model with 9 df. 11.3.3 Cross-Validation with the Lasso Normally, cross-validation methods are used to determine how much shrinkage should be used. We’ll use the cv.lars function. 10-fold (K = 10) cross-validation the data are randomly divided into 10 groups. Nine groups are used to predict the remaining group for each group in turn. Overall prediction performance is computed, and the machine calculates a cross-validation criterion (mean squared error) and standard error for that criterion. The cross-validation plot is the second lasso plot. set.seed(432) lassocv &lt;- cv.lars(preds, prost$lpsa, K=10) ## default cv.lars K is 10 We’re looking to minimize cross-validated mean squared error in this plot, which doesn’t seem to happen until the fraction gets very close to 1. 11.3.4 What value of the key fraction minimizes cross-validated MSE? frac &lt;- lassocv$index[which.min(lassocv$cv)] frac [1] 0.989899 The cross-validation plot suggests we use a fraction of nearly 1.0, suggesting that all of the predictors will be kept in, based on the top LASSO plot. par(mfrow=c(2,1)) lasso1 &lt;- lars(preds, prost$lpsa, type=&quot;lasso&quot;) plot(lasso1) set.seed(432) lassocv &lt;- cv.lars(preds, prost$lpsa, K=10) par(mfrow=c(1,1)) 11.3.5 Coefficients for the Model Identified by the Cross-Validation coef.cv &lt;- coef(lasso1, s=frac, mode=&quot;fraction&quot;) round(coef.cv,4) lcavol lweight age bph_f svi_f lcp gleason_f 0.5529 0.6402 -0.0217 0.1535 0.7750 -0.1155 -0.1826 pgg45 0.0030 So the model suggested by the lasso still includes all eight of these predictors. 11.3.6 Obtaining Fitted Values from Lasso fits.cv &lt;- predict.lars(lasso1, preds, s=frac, type=&quot;fit&quot;, mode=&quot;fraction&quot;) fits.cv $s [1] 0.989899 $fraction [1] 0.989899 $mode [1] &quot;fraction&quot; $fit [1] 0.7995838 0.7493971 0.5111634 0.6098520 1.7001847 0.8338020 1.8288518 [8] 2.1302316 1.2487955 1.2661752 1.4704969 0.7782005 2.0755860 1.9129272 [15] 2.1533975 1.8124981 1.2713610 2.3993624 1.3232566 1.7709029 1.9757841 [22] 2.7451649 1.1658326 2.4825521 1.8036338 1.9112578 2.0144298 1.7829219 [29] 1.9706111 2.1688199 2.0377131 1.8657882 1.6955904 1.3580186 1.0516394 [36] 2.9097450 2.1898622 1.0454123 3.8896481 1.7971270 2.0932871 2.3253395 [43] 2.0809295 2.5303655 2.4451523 2.5827203 4.0692397 2.6845105 2.7034959 [50] 1.9590266 2.4522082 2.9801227 2.1902084 3.0559124 3.3447025 2.9765233 [57] 1.7620182 2.3424646 2.2856404 2.6188548 2.3056410 3.5568662 2.9756755 [64] 3.6764122 2.5097586 2.6579014 2.9482717 3.0892917 1.5113015 3.0282296 [71] 3.2887119 2.1083273 2.8889223 3.4903026 3.6959516 3.6070031 3.2749993 [78] 3.4518575 3.4049180 3.1814731 2.0496216 2.8986175 3.6743113 3.3292860 [85] 2.6965297 3.8339856 2.9892543 3.0555536 4.2903885 3.0986508 3.3784385 [92] 4.0205201 3.8309974 4.7531590 3.6290575 4.1347645 4.0982744 11.3.7 Complete Set of Fitted Values from the Lasso round(fits.cv$fit,3) [1] 0.800 0.749 0.511 0.610 1.700 0.834 1.829 2.130 1.249 1.266 1.470 [12] 0.778 2.076 1.913 2.153 1.812 1.271 2.399 1.323 1.771 1.976 2.745 [23] 1.166 2.483 1.804 1.911 2.014 1.783 1.971 2.169 2.038 1.866 1.696 [34] 1.358 1.052 2.910 2.190 1.045 3.890 1.797 2.093 2.325 2.081 2.530 [45] 2.445 2.583 4.069 2.685 2.703 1.959 2.452 2.980 2.190 3.056 3.345 [56] 2.977 1.762 2.342 2.286 2.619 2.306 3.557 2.976 3.676 2.510 2.658 [67] 2.948 3.089 1.511 3.028 3.289 2.108 2.889 3.490 3.696 3.607 3.275 [78] 3.452 3.405 3.181 2.050 2.899 3.674 3.329 2.697 3.834 2.989 3.056 [89] 4.290 3.099 3.378 4.021 3.831 4.753 3.629 4.135 4.098 To assess the quality of these predictions, we might plot them against the observed values of our outcome (lpsa), or we might look at residuals vs. these fitted values. prost_lasso_res &lt;- data_frame(fitted = fits.cv$fit, actual = prost$lpsa, resid = actual - fitted) ggplot(prost_lasso_res, aes(x = actual, y = fitted)) + geom_point() + geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0) + labs(y = &quot;Fitted log(PSA) from Cross-Validated LASSO&quot;, x = &quot;Observed values of log(PSA)&quot;, title = &quot;Fitted vs. Actual Values of log(PSA)&quot;) ggplot(prost_lasso_res, aes(x = fitted, y = resid)) + geom_point() + geom_hline(yintercept = 0, col = &quot;red&quot;) + geom_smooth(method = &quot;loess&quot;, col = &quot;blue&quot;, se = F) + labs(x = &quot;LASSO-fitted log(PSA)&quot;, y = &quot;Residuals from Cross-Validated LASSO model&quot;, title = &quot;Residuals vs. Fitted Values of log(PSA) from LASSO&quot;, subtitle = &quot;with loess smooth&quot;) 11.3.8 When is the Lasso Most Useful? As Faraway (2015) suggests, the lasso is particularly useful when we believe the effects are sparse, in the sense that we believe that few of the many predictors we are evaluating have a meaningful effect. Consider, for instance, the analysis of gene expression data, where we have good reason to believe that only a small number of genes have an influence on our response of interest. Or, in medical claims data, where we can have thousands of available codes to search through that may apply to some of the people included in a large analysis relating health care costs to outcomes. 11.4 Applying the Lasso to the pollution data Let’s consider the lasso approach in application to the pollution data we’ve seen previously. Recall that we have 60 observations on an outcome, y, and 15 predictors, labeled x1 through x15. preds &lt;- with(pollution, cbind(x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6, x7, x8, x9, x10, x11, x12, x13, x14, x15)) lasso_p1 &lt;- lars(preds, pollution$y, type=&quot;lasso&quot;) plot(lasso_p1) summary(lasso_p1) LARS/LASSO Call: lars(x = preds, y = pollution$y, type = &quot;lasso&quot;) Df Rss Cp 0 1 228311 129.1367 1 2 185419 95.9802 2 3 149370 68.4323 3 4 143812 65.8764 4 5 92077 25.4713 5 6 83531 20.4668 6 7 69532 10.9922 7 8 67682 11.4760 8 9 60689 7.7445 9 10 60167 9.3163 10 11 59609 10.8588 11 12 58287 11.7757 12 13 57266 12.9383 13 14 56744 14.5107 14 13 56159 12.0311 15 14 55238 13.2765 16 15 53847 14.1361 17 16 53681 16.0000 Based on the Cp statistics, it looks like the big improvements occur somewhere around the move from 6 to 7 df. Let’s look at the cross-validation set.seed(432012) pollution_lassocv &lt;- cv.lars(preds, pollution$y, K=10) Here it looks like cross-validated MSE happens somewhere between a fraction of 0.2 and 0.4. frac &lt;- pollution_lassocv$index[which.min(pollution_lassocv$cv)] frac [1] 0.3535354 par(mfrow=c(2,1)) lasso_p1 &lt;- lars(preds, pollution$y, type=&quot;lasso&quot;) plot(lasso_p1) set.seed(432012) pollution_lassocv &lt;- cv.lars(preds, pollution$y, K=10) par(mfrow=c(1,1)) It looks like a model with 6-8 predictors will be the most useful. The cross-validated coefficients are as follows: poll.cv &lt;- coef(lasso_p1, s=frac, mode=&quot;fraction&quot;) round(poll.cv,3) x1 x2 x3 x4 x5 x6 x7 x8 x9 1.471 -1.164 -1.102 0.000 0.000 -10.610 -0.457 0.003 3.918 x10 x11 x12 x13 x14 x15 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.228 0.000 Note that by this cross-validated lasso selection, not only are the coefficients for the 8 variables remaining in the model shrunken, but variables x4, x5, x10, x11, x12, x13 and x15 are all dropped from the model, and model x8 almost is, as well. poll_fits &lt;- predict.lars(lasso_p1, preds, s=frac, type=&quot;fit&quot;, mode=&quot;fraction&quot;) round(poll_fits$fit,3) [1] 932.627 918.415 921.904 987.396 1050.184 1065.837 912.424 [8] 916.605 949.647 926.168 996.625 1017.362 977.730 954.550 [15] 931.455 894.263 931.551 868.599 973.471 940.937 881.867 [22] 906.666 973.609 919.640 933.821 956.352 913.018 925.650 [29] 874.528 983.829 1042.870 915.002 937.760 885.464 989.947 [36] 931.709 1013.795 969.729 1003.962 983.813 896.042 918.446 [43] 934.609 1004.565 910.273 976.747 831.132 907.996 826.485 [50] 895.082 909.398 917.969 926.777 917.381 991.266 879.972 [57] 942.867 913.737 960.952 949.030 Here’s a plot of the actual pollution y values, against these fitted values. poll_lasso_res &lt;- data_frame(fitted = poll_fits$fit, actual = pollution$y, resid = actual - fitted) ggplot(poll_lasso_res, aes(x = actual, y = fitted)) + geom_point() + geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0) + labs(y = &quot;Fitted y values from Cross-Validated LASSO&quot;, x = &quot;Observed values of y = Age-Adjusted Mortality Rate&quot;, title = &quot;Fitted vs. Actual Values of Age-Adjusted Mortality&quot;) And now, here’s a plot or residuals vs. fitted values. ggplot(poll_lasso_res, aes(x = fitted, y = resid)) + geom_point() + geom_hline(yintercept = 0, col = &quot;red&quot;) + geom_smooth(method = &quot;loess&quot;, col = &quot;blue&quot;, se = F) + labs(x = &quot;LASSO-fitted Age-Adjusted Mortality&quot;, y = &quot;Residuals from Cross-Validated LASSO model&quot;, title = &quot;Residuals vs. Fitted Values of Age-Adjusted Mortality from LASSO&quot;, subtitle = &quot;with loess smooth&quot;) References "],

L. Ramsey and Schafer (2002) (chapters 20-21), Vittinghoff et al. (2012) (chapter 5) and Faraway (2006) (chapter 2). 12.1 A First Attempt: A Linear Probability Model Suppose we want to predict a binary outcome which takes on the value 1 or 0, based on a single quantitative predictor. Let y be a 1/0 outcome, and x be a quantitative predictor in the following simulation. set.seed(432) sim12 &lt;- data_frame(x = rnorm(100, 10, 3), err = rnorm(100, 0, 2), y = ifelse(x + err &gt; 10, 1, 0)) sim12 &lt;- select(sim12, x, y) ggplot(sim12, aes(x = x, y = y)) + geom_point() Now, we want to use our variable x here to predict our variable y (which takes on the values 0 and 1). One approach to doing this would be a linear probability model, as follows: mod12a &lt;- lm(y ~ x, data = sim12) summary(mod12a) Call: lm(formula = y ~ x, data = sim12) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -0.74104 -0.23411 -0.02894 0.23117 0.83153 Coefficients: Estimate Std.

What’s wrong here? ggplot(sim12, aes(x = x, y = y)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;) + labs(title = &quot;Linear Probability Model&quot;) If y can only take the values 0 and 1 (or, more precisely, if we’re trying to predict the value \\(\\pi\\) = Pr(y = 1)) then what do we do with the predictions that are outside the range of (0, 1)? 12.2 Logistic Regression Logistic regression is the most common model used when the outcome is binary. Our response variable is assumed to take on two values, zero or one, and we then describe the probability of a “one” response, given a linear function of explanatory predictors. We use logistic regression rather than linear regression for predicting binary outcomes. Linear regression approaches to the problem of predicting probabilities are problematic for several reasons - not least of which being that they predict probabilities greater than one and less than zero. There are several available alternatives, including probit regression and binomial regression, for the problem of predicting a binary outcome. Logistic regression is part of a class called generalized linear models which extend the linear regression model in a variety of ways. There are also several extensions to the logistic regression model, including multinomial logistic regression (which is used for nominal categorical outcomes with more than two levels) and ordered logistic regression (used for ordered multi-categorical outcomes.) The methods involved in binary logistic regression may also be extended to the case where the outcomes are proportions based on counts, often through grouped binary responses (the proportion of cells with chromosomal aberrations, or the proportion of subjects who develop a particular condition.) Although the models are different in some crucial ways, the practical use of logistic regression tracks well with much of what we’ve learned about linear regression. 12.3 The Logistic Regression Model A generalized linear model (or GLM) is a probability model in which the mean of an outcome is related to predictors through a regression equation. A link function g is used to relate the mean, \\(\\mu\\), to a linear regression of the predictors \\(X_1, X_2, ..., X_k\\). \\[ g(\\mu) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\beta_2 X_2 + ... + \\beta_k X_k \\] In the case of a logistic regression model, the mean \\(\\mu\\) of our 0/1 outcome is represented by \\(\\pi\\) which describes the probability of a “1” outcome. the linking function we use in logistic regression makes use of the logit function, which is built on the natural logarithm. 12.4 The Link Function Logistic regression is a non-linear regression approach, since the equation for the mean of the 0/1 Y values conditioned on the values of our predictors \\(X_1, X_2, ..., X_k\\) turns out to be non-linear in the \\(\\beta\\) coefficients. Its nonlinearity, however, is solely found in its link function, hence the term generalized linear model. The particular link function we use in logistic regression is called the logit link. \\[ logit(\\pi) = log\\left( \\frac{\\pi}{1 - \\pi} \\right) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\beta_2 X_2 + ... + \\beta_k X_k \\] The inverse of the logit function is called the logistic function. If logit(\\(\\pi\\)) = \\(\\eta\\), then \\(\\pi = \\frac{exp(\\eta)}{1 + exp(\\eta)}\\) The plot below displays the logistic function \\(y = \\frac{e^x}{1 + e^x}\\) As you can see in the figure above, the logistic function \\(\\frac{e^x}{1 + e^x}\\) takes any value \\(x\\) in the real numbers and returns a value between 0 and 1. 12.5 The logit or log odds We usually focus on the logit in statistical work, which is the inverse of the logistic function. If we have a probability \\(\\pi &lt; 0.5\\), then \\(logit(\\pi) &lt; 0\\). If our probability \\(\\pi &gt; 0.5\\), then \\(logit(\\pi) &gt; 0\\). Finally, if \\(\\pi = 0.5\\), then \\(logit(\\pi) = 0\\). 12.6 Interpreting the Coefficients of a Logistic Regression Model The critical thing to remember in interpreting a logistic regression model is that the logit is the log odds function. Exponentiating the logit yields the odds. So, suppose we have a yes/no outcome variable, where yes = 1, and no = 0, and \\(\\pi\\) = Pr(y = 1). Our model holds that: \\[ logit(\\pi) = log\\left( \\frac{\\pi}{1 - \\pi} \\right) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\beta_2 X_2 + ... + \\beta_k X_k \\] The odds of a yes response (the odds that Y = 1) at the level \\(X_1, X_2, ..., X_k\\) are: \\[ Odds(Y = 1) = exp(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\beta_2 X_2 + ... + \\beta_k X_k) \\] The probability of a yes response (Pr(y = 1), or \\(\\pi\\)) is just \\[ \\pi = Pr(Y = 1) = \\frac{Odds(Y = 1)}{1 + Odds(Y = 1)} = \\frac{exp(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\beta_2 X_2 + ... + \\beta_k X_k)}{1 + exp(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\beta_2 X_2 + ... + \\beta_k X_k)} \\] 12.7 The Logistic Regression has non-constant variance In ordinary least squares regression, the variance \\(Var(Y | X_1, X_2, ..., X_k) = \\sigma^2\\) is a constant that does not depend on the predictor values. This is not the case in logistic regression. The mean and variance specifications of the logistic regression model are quite different. \\[ logit(\\pi) = log\\left( \\frac{\\pi}{1 - \\pi} \\right) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\beta_2 X_2 + ... + \\beta_k X_k \\\\ \\mu[Y | X_1, ..., X_k] = \\pi, \\\\ Var[Y | X_1, ..., X_k] = \\pi(1 - \\pi) \\] The variance is now a function of the mean, and contains no additional parameter for us to estimate. 12.8 Fitting a Logistic Regression Model to our Simulated Data Recall the sim12 data we built earlier. ggplot(sim12, aes(x = x, y = y)) + geom_point() Here is the fitted logistic regression model. model12b &lt;- glm(y ~ x, data = sim12, family = binomial) model12b Call: glm(formula = y ~ x, family = binomial, data = sim12) Coefficients: (Intercept) x -9.1955 0.9566 Degrees of Freedom: 99 Total (i.e. Null); 98 Residual Null Deviance: 138.6 Residual Deviance: 70.03 AIC: 74.03 The logistic regression equation is: \\[ logit(Pr(y = 1)) = log\\left( \\frac{Pr(y = 1)}{1 - Pr(y = 1)} \\right) = -9.1955 + 0.9566 x \\] We can exponentiate the results of this model to get to an equation about odds, and eventually, a prediction about probabilities. Suppose, for instance, that we are interested in the prediction when x = 12. \\[ logit(Pr(y = 1) | X = 12) = log\\left( \\frac{Pr(y = 1)}{1 - Pr(y = 1)} \\right) = -9.1955 + 0.9566 * 12 = 2.2837 \\] And we can also get this from the predict function applied to our model, although the predict approach retains a few more decimal places internally: predict(model12b, newdata = data.frame(x = 12)) 1 2.284069 \\[ Odds(Y = 1 | X = 12) = exp(-9.20 + 0.96 * 12) = exp(2.2837) = 9.812921 \\] exp(predict(model12b, newdata = data.frame(x = 12))) 1 9.81654 The estimated probability of a yes response (Pr(y = 1), or \\(\\pi\\)) if x = 12 is just \\[ \\pi = Pr(Y = 1 | X = 12) = \\frac{Odds(Y = 1 | X = 12)}{1 + Odds(Y = 1 | X = 12)} = \\frac{exp(-9.20 + 0.96 x)}{1 + exp(-9.20 + 0.96 x)} = \\frac{9.812921}{1 + 9.812921} = 0.908 \\] Does this work out? exp(predict(model12b, newdata = data.frame(x = 12))) / (1 + exp(predict(model12b, newdata = data.frame(x = 12)))) 1 0.907549 which is also directly available by running predict with type = &quot;response&quot;. predict(model12b, newdata = data.frame(x = 12), type = &quot;response&quot;) 1 0.907549 12.9 Plotting the Logistic Regression Model We can use the augment function from the broom package to get our fitted probabilities included in the data. m12b.aug &lt;- augment(model12b, sim12, type.predict = &quot;response&quot;) ggplot(m12b.aug, aes(x = x, y = y)) + geom_point() + geom_line(aes(x = x, y = .fitted), col = &quot;blue&quot;) + labs(title = &quot;Fitted Logistic Regression Model for sim12&quot;) I’ll add a little jitter on the vertical scale to the points, so we can avoid overlap, and also make the points a little bigger. ggplot(m12b.aug, aes(x = x, y = y)) + geom_jitter(height = 0.05, size = 2, pch = 21, fill = &quot;cornflowerblue&quot;) + geom_line(aes(x = x, y = .fitted), col = &quot;blue&quot;) + labs(title = &quot;Fitted Logistic Regression for sim12&quot;) + theme_bw() All right, it’s time to move on to fitting models. We’ll do that in the next Chapter. References "],

Our goal will be to understand the characteristics of the patients, and how they relate to the binary outcome of interest, death. 13.2 Running A Simple Logistic Regression Model In the most common scenario, a logistic regression model is used to predict a binary outcome (which can take on the values 0 or 1.) We will eventually fit a logistic regression model in two ways. Through the glm function in the base package of R (similar to lm for linear regression) Through the lrm function available in the rms package (similar to ols for linear regression) We’ll focus on the glm approach first, and save the lrm ideas for later in this Chapter. 13.2.1 Logistic Regression Can Be Harder than Linear Regression Logistic regression models are fitted using the method of maximum likelihood in glm, which requires multiple iterations until convergence is reached. Logistic regression models are harder to interpret (for most people) than linear regressions. Logistic regression models don’t have the same set of assumptions as linear models. Logistic regression outcomes (yes/no) carry much less information than quantitative outcomes. As a result, fitting a reasonable logistic regression requires more data than a linear model of similar size. The rule I learned in graduate school was that a logistic regression requires 100 observations to fit an intercept plus another 15 observations for each candidate predictor. That’s not terrible, but it’s a very large sample size. Frank Harrell recommends that 96 observations + a function of the number of candidate predictors (which depends on the amount of variation in the predictors, but 15 x the number of such predictors isn’t too bad if the signal to noise ratio is pretty good) are required just to get reasonable confidence intervals around your predictions. In a twitter note, Frank suggests that 96 + 8 times the number of candidate parameters might be reasonable so long as the smallest cell of interest (combination of an outcome and a split of the covariates) is 96 or more observations. Peduzzi et al. (1996) suggest that if we let \\(\\pi\\) be the smaller of the proportions of “yes” or “no” cases in the population of interest, and k be the number of inputs under consideration, then \\(N = 10k/\\pi\\) is the minimum number of cases to include, except that if N &lt; 100 by this standard, you should increase it to 100, according to Long (1997). That suggests that if you have an outcome that happens 10% of the time, and you are running a model with 3 predictors, then you could get away with \\((10 \\times 3)/(0.10) = 300\\) observations, but if your outcome happened 40% of the time, you could get away with only \\((10 \\times 3)/(0.40) = 75\\) observations, which you’d round up to 100. 13.3 Logistic Regression using glm We’ll begin by attempting to predict death based on the extent of the resection. res_modA &lt;- glm(died ~ resection, data=resect, family=&quot;binomial&quot;(link=&quot;logit&quot;)) res_modA Call: glm(formula = died ~ resection, family = binomial(link = &quot;logit&quot;), data = resect) Coefficients: (Intercept) resection -4.4337 0.7417 Degrees of Freedom: 133 Total (i.e. Null); 132 Residual Null Deviance: 101.9 Residual Deviance: 89.49 AIC: 93.49 Note that the logit link is the default approach with the binomial family, so we could also have used: res_modA &lt;- glm(died ~ resection, data = resect, family = &quot;binomial&quot;) which yields the same model. 13.3.1 Interpreting the Coefficients of a Logistic Regression Model Our model is: \\[ logit(died = 1) = log\\left(\\frac{Pr(died = 1)}{1 - Pr(died = 1)}\\right) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x = -4.4337 + 0.7417 \\times resection \\] The predicted log odds of death for a subject with a resection of 4 cm is: \\[ log\\left(\\frac{Pr(died = 1)}{1 - Pr(died = 1)}\\right) = -4.4337 + 0.7417 \\times 4 = -1.467 \\] The predicted odds of death for a subject with a resection of 4 cm is thus: \\[ \\frac{Pr(died = 1)}{1 - Pr(died = 1)} = e^{-4.4337 + 0.7417 \\times 4} = e^{-1.467} = 0.2306 \\] Since the odds are less than 1, we should find that the probability of death is less than 1/2. With a little algebra, we see that the predicted probability of death for a subject with a resection of 4 cm is: \\[ Pr(died = 1) = \\frac{e^{-4.4337 + 0.7417 \\times 4}}{1 + e^{-4.4337 + 0.7417 \\times 4}} = \\frac{e^{-1.467}}{1 + e^{-1.467}} = \\frac{0.2306}{1.2306} = 0.187 \\] In general, we can frame the model in terms of a statement about probabilities, like this: \\[ Pr(died = 1) = \\frac{e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x}}{1 + {e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x}}} = \\frac{e^{-4.4337 + 0.7417 \\times resection}}{1 + e^{-4.4337 + 0.7417 \\times resection}} \\] and so by substituting in values for resection, we can estimate the model’s fitted probabilities of death. 13.3.2 Using predict to describe the model’s fits To obtain these fitted odds and probabilities in R, we can use the predict function. The default predictions are on the scale of the log odds. These predictions are also available through the type = &quot;link&quot; command within the predict function for a generalized linear model like logistic regression. Here are the predicted log odds of death for a subject (Sally) with a 4 cm resection and a subject (Harry) who had a 5 cm resection. predict(res_modA, newdata = data_frame(resection = c(4,5))) 1 2 -1.4669912 -0.7253027 We can also obtain predictions for each subject on the original response (here, probability) scale, backing out of the logit link. predict(res_modA, newdata = data_frame(resection = c(4, 5)), type = &quot;response&quot;) 1 2 0.1874004 0.3262264 So the predicted probability of death is 0.187 for Sally, the subject with a 4 cm resection, and 0.326 for Harry, the subject with a 5 cm resection. 13.3.3 Odds Ratio interpretation of Coefficients Often, we will exponentiate the estimated slope coefficients of a logistic regression model to help us understand the impact of changing a predictor on the odds of our outcome. exp(coef(res_modA)) (Intercept) resection 0.01186995 2.09947754 To interpret this finding, suppose we have two subjects, Harry and Sally. Harry had a resection that was 1 cm larger than Sally. This estimated coefficient suggests that the estimated odds for death associated with Harry is 2.099 times larger than the odds for death associated with Sally. In general, the odds ratio comparing two subjects who differ by 1 cm on the resection length is 2.099. To illustrate, again let’s assume that Harry’s resection was 5 cm, and Sally’s was 4 cm. Then we have: \\[ log\\left(\\frac{Pr(Harry died)}{1 - Pr(Harry died)}\\right) = -4.4337 + 0.7417 \\times 5 = -0.7253, \\\\ log\\left(\\frac{Pr(Sally died)}{1 - Pr(Sally died)}\\right) = -4.4337 + 0.7417 \\times 4 = -1.4667. \\] which implies that our estimated odds of death for Harry and Sally are: \\[ Odds(Harry died) = \\frac{Pr(Harry died)}{1 - Pr(Harry died)} = e^{-4.4337 + 0.7417 \\times 5} = e^{-0.7253} = 0.4842 \\\\ Odds(Sally died) = \\frac{Pr(Sally died)}{1 - Pr(Sally died)} = e^{-4.4337 + 0.7417 \\times 4} = e^{-1.4667} = 0.2307 \\] and so the odds ratio is: \\[ OR = \\frac{Odds(Harry died)}{Odds(Sally died)} = \\frac{0.4842}{0.2307} = 2.099 \\] If the odds ratio was 1, that would mean that Harry and Sally had the same estimated odds of death, and thus the same estimated probability of death, despite having different sizes of resections. Since the odds ratio is greater than 1, it means that Harry has a higher estimated odds of death than Sally, and thus that Harry has a higher estimated probability of death than Sally. If the odds ratio was less than 1, it would mean that Harry had a lower estimated odds of death than Sally, and thus that Harry had a lower estimated probability of death than Sally. Remember that the odds ratio is a fraction describing two positive numbers (odds can only be non-negative) so that the smallest possible odds ratio is 0. 13.3.4 Interpreting the rest of the model output from glm res_modA Call: glm(formula = died ~ resection, family = &quot;binomial&quot;, data = resect) Coefficients: (Intercept) resection -4.4337 0.7417 Degrees of Freedom: 133 Total (i.e. Null); 132 Residual Null Deviance: 101.9 Residual Deviance: 89.49 AIC: 93.49 In addition to specifying the logistic regression coefficients, we are also presented with information on degrees of freedom, deviance (null and residual) and AIC. The degrees of freedom indicate the sample size. Recall that we had n = 134 subjects in the data. The “Null” model includes only an intercept term (which uses 1 df) and we thus have n - 1 (here 133) degrees of freedom available for estimation. In our res_modA model, a logistic regression is fit including a single slope (resection) and an intercept term. Each uses up one degree of freedom to build an estimate, so we have n - 2 = 134 - 2 = 132 residual df remaining. The AIC or Akaike Information Criterion (lower values are better) is also provided. This is helpful if we’re comparing multiple models for the same outcome. 13.3.5 Deviance and Comparing Our Model to the Null Model The deviance (a measure of the model’s lack of fit) is available for both the null model (the model with only an intercept) and for our model (res_modA) predicting our outcome, mortality. The deviance test, though available in R (see below) isn’t really a test of whether the model works well. Instead, it assumes the model is true, and then tests to see if the coefficients are detectably different from zero. So it isn’t of much practical use. To compare the deviance statistics, we can subtract the residual deviance from the null deviance to describe the impact of our model on fit. Null Deviance - Residual Deviance can be compared to a \\(\\chi^2\\) distribution with Null DF - Residual DF degrees of freedom to obtain a global test of the in-sample predictive power of our model. We can see this comparison more directly by running anova on our model: anova(res_modA) Analysis of Deviance Table Model: binomial, link: logit Response: died Terms added sequentially (first to last) Df Deviance Resid. Df Resid. Dev NULL 133 101.943 resection 1 12.45 132 89.493 To complete a deviance test and obtain a p value, we can run the following code to estimate the probability that a chi-square distribution with a single degree of freedom would exhibit an improvement in deviance as large as 12.45. pchisq(12.45, 1, lower.tail = FALSE) [1] 0.0004179918 The p value for the deviance test here is about 0.0004. But, again, this isn’t a test of whether the model is any good - it assumes the model is true, and then tests some consequences. Specifically, it tests whether (if the model is TRUE) some of the model’s coefficients are non-zero. That’s not so practically useful, so I discourage you from performing global tests of a logistic regression model with a deviance test. 13.3.6 Using glance with a logistic regression model We can use the glance function from the broom package to obtain the null and residual deviance and degrees of freedom. Note that the deviance for our model is related to the log likelihood by -2*logLik. glance(res_modA) null.deviance df.null logLik AIC BIC deviance df.residual 1 101.9431 133 -44.74646 93.49292 99.2886 89.49292 132 The glance result also provides the AIC, and the BIC (Bayes Information Criterion), each of which is helpful in understanding comparisons between multiple models for the same outcome (with smaller values of either criterion indicating better models.) The AIC is based on the deviance, but penalizes you for making the model more complicated. The BIC does the same sort of thing but with a different penalty. Again we see that we have a null deviance of 101.94 on 133 degrees of freedom. Including the resection information in the model decreased the deviance to 89.49 points on 132 degrees of freedom, so that’s a decrease of 12.45 points while using one degree of freedom, a statistically significant reduction in deviance. 13.4 Interpreting the Model Summary Let’s get a more detailed summary of our res_modA model, including 95% confidence intervals for the coefficients: summary(res_modA) Call: glm(formula = died ~ resection, family = &quot;binomial&quot;, data = resect) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.1844 -0.5435 -0.3823 -0.2663 2.4501 Coefficients: Estimate Std.

We still have a five-number summary of residuals, although these are called deviance residuals. We have a table of coefficients with standard errors, and hypothesis tests, although these are Wald z-tests, rather than the t tests we saw in linear modeling. We have a summary of global fit in the comparison of null deviance and residual deviance, but without a formal p value. And we have the AIC, as discussed above. We also have some new items related to a dispersion parameter and to the number of Fisher Scoring Iterations. Let’s walk through each of these elements. 13.4.1 Wald Z tests for Coefficients in a Logistic Regression The coefficients output provides the estimated coefficients, and their standard errors, plus a Wald Z statistic, which is just the estimated coefficient divided by its standard error. This is compared to a standard Normal distribution to obtain the two-tailed p values summarized in the Pr(&gt;|z|) column. The interesting result is resection, which has a Wald Z = 3.327, yielding a p value of 0.00088. The hypotheses being tested here are H0: resection does not have an effect on the log odds of died vs. HA: resection does have such an effect. Another way of stating this is that the p value assesses whether the estimated coefficient of resection, 0.7417, is statistically detectably different from 0. If the coefficient (on the logit scale) for resection was truly 0, this would mean that: the log odds of death did not change based on the resection size, the odds of death were unchanged based on the resection size (the odds ratio would be 1), and the probability of death was unchanged based on the resection size. In our case, we have a statistically detectable change in the log odds of died associated with changes in resection, according to this p value. We conclude that resection size is associated with a positive impact on death rates (death rates are generally higher for people with larger resections.) 13.4.2 Confidence Intervals for the Coefficients As in linear regression, we can obtain 95% confidence intervals (to get other levels, change the level parameter in confint) for the intercept and slope coefficients. Here, we see, for example, that the coefficient of resection has a point estimate of 0.7417, and a confidence interval of (0.3229, 1.208). Since this is on the logit scale, it’s not that interpretable, but we will often exponentiate the model and its confidence interval to obtain a more interpretable result on the odds ratio scale. exp(coef(res_modA)) (Intercept) resection 0.01186995 2.09947754 exp(confint(res_modA)) Waiting for profiling to be done... 2.5 % 97.5 % (Intercept) 0.001756429 0.05750655 resection 1.381124459 3.34782604 From this output, we can estimate the odds ratio for death associated with a 1 cm increase in resection size is 2.099, with a 95% CI of (1.38, 3.35). - If the odds ratio was 1, it would indicate that the odds of death did not change based on the change in resection size. - Here, it’s clear that the estimated odds of death will be larger (odds &gt; 1) for subjects with larger resection sizes. Larger odds of death also indicate larger probabilities of death. This confidence interval indicates that with 95% confidence, we conclude that increases in resection size are associated with statistically detectable increases in the odds of death. - If the odds ratio was less than 1 (remember that it cannot be less than 0) that would mean that subjects with larger resection sizes were associated with smaller estimated odds of death. 13.4.3 Deviance Residuals In logistic regression, it’s certainly a good idea to check to see how well the model fits the data. However, there are a few different types of residuals. The residuals presented here by default are called deviance residuals. Other types of residuals are available for generalized linear models, such as Pearson residuals, working residuals, and response residuals. Logistic regression model diagnostics often make use of multiple types of residuals. The deviance residuals for each individual subject sum up to the deviance statistic for the model, and describe the contribution of each point to the model likelihood function. The deviance residual, \\(d_i\\), for the ith observation in a model predicting \\(y_i\\) (a binary variable), with the estimate being \\(\\hat{\\pi}_i\\) is: \\[ d_i = s_i \\sqrt{-2 [y_i log \\hat{\\pi_i} + (1 - y_i) log(1 - \\hat{\\pi_i})]}, \\] where \\(s_i\\) is 1 if \\(y_i = 1\\) and \\(s_i = -1\\) if \\(y_i = 0\\). Again, the sum of the deviance residuals is the deviance. 13.4.4 Dispersion Parameter The dispersion parameter is taken to be 1 for glm fit using either the binomial or Poisson families. For other sorts of generalized linear models, the dispersion parameter will be of some importance in estimating standard errors sensibly. 13.4.5 Fisher Scoring iterations The solution of a logistic regression model involves maximizing a likelihood function. Fisher’s scoring algorithm in our res_modA needed five iterations to perform the logistic regression fit. All that this tells you is that the model converged, and didn’t require a lot of time to do so. 13.5 Plotting a Simple Logistic Regression Model Let’s plot the logistic regression model res_modA for died using the extent of the resection in terms of probabilities. We can use either of two different approaches: we can plot the fitted values from our specific model against the original data, using the augment function from the broom package, or we can create a smooth function called binomial_smooth that plots a simple logistic model in an analogous way to geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;) for a simple linear regression. 13.5.1 Using augment to capture the fitted probabilities res_A_aug &lt;- augment(res_modA, resect, type.predict = &quot;response&quot;) head(res_A_aug) id age prior resection intubated died .fitted .se.fit .resid 1 1 34 1 2.5 0 0 0.07046791 0.02562381 -0.3822929 2 2 57 0 5.0 0 0 0.32622637 0.08605551 -0.8886631 3 3 60 1 4.0 1 1 0.18740037 0.04269795 1.8300317 4 4 62 1 4.2 0 0 0.21104240 0.04871389 -0.6885386 5 5 28 0 6.0 1 1 0.50409637 0.14302982 1.1704596 6 6 52 0 3.0 0 0 0.09897375 0.02867196 -0.4565542 .hat .sigma .cooksd .std.resid 1 0.010024061 0.8258481 0.0003876961 -0.3842235 2 0.033691765 0.8227475 0.0087350915 -0.9040227 3 0.011972088 0.8107264 0.0265893468 1.8410857 4 0.014252277 0.8243062 0.0019617278 -0.6934983 5 0.081835623 0.8196110 0.0477480056 1.2215077 6 0.009218619 0.8255581 0.0005157780 -0.4586733 This approach augments the resect data set with fitted, residual and other summaries of each observation’s impact on the fit, using the “response” type of prediction, which yields the fitted probabilities in the .fitted column. 13.5.2 Plotting a Logistic Regression Model’s Fitted Values ggplot(res_A_aug, aes(x = resection, y = died)) + geom_jitter(height = 0.05) + geom_line(aes(x = resection, y = .fitted), col = &quot;blue&quot;) + labs(title = &quot;Logistic Regression from Model res_modA&quot;) 13.5.3 Plotting a Simple Logistic Model using binomial_smooth binomial_smooth &lt;- function(...) { geom_smooth(method = &quot;glm&quot;, method.args = list(family = &quot;binomial&quot;), ...) } ggplot(resect, aes(x = resection, y = died)) + geom_jitter(height = 0.05) + binomial_smooth() + ## ...smooth(se=FALSE) to leave out interval labs(title = &quot;Logistic Regression from Model A&quot;) + theme_bw() As expected, we see an increase in the model probability of death as the extent of the resection grows larger. 13.6 How well does Model A classify subjects? A natural question to ask is how well does our model classify patients in terms of likelihood of death. We could specify a particular rule, for example: if the predicted probability of death is 0.5 or greater, then predict “Died”. res_A_aug$rule.5 &lt;- ifelse(res_A_aug$.fitted &gt;= 0.5, &quot;Predict Died&quot;, &quot;Predict Alive&quot;) table(res_A_aug$rule.5, res_A_aug$died) 0 1 Predict Alive 114 16 Predict Died 3 1 And perhaps build the linked table of row probabilities which tells us, for example, that 87.69% of the patients predicted by the model to be alive actually did survive. round(100*prop.table( table(res_A_aug$rule.5, res_A_aug$died), 1), 2) 0 1 Predict Alive 87.69 12.31 Predict Died 75.00 25.00 Or the table of column probabilities which tell us, for example, that 97.44% of those who actually survived were predicted by the model to be alive. round(100*prop.table( table(res_A_aug$rule.5, res_A_aug$died), 2), 2) 0 1 Predict Alive 97.44 94.12 Predict Died 2.56 5.88 We’ll discuss various measures of concordance derived from this sort of classification later. 13.7 Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve Analysis One way to assess the predictive accuracy within the model development sample in a logistic regression is to consider an analyses based on the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. ROC curves are commonly used in assessing diagnoses in medical settings, and in signal detection applications. The accuracy of a “test” can be evaluated by considering two types of errors: false positives and false negatives. In our res_modA model, we use resection size to predict whether the patient died. Suppose we established a value R, so that if the resection size was larger than R cm, we would predict that the patient died, and otherwise we would predict that the patient did not die. A good outcome of our model’s “test”, then, would be when the resection size is larger than R for a patient who actually died. Another good outcome would be when the resection size is smaller than R for a patient who survived. But we can make errors, too. A false positive error in this setting would occur when the resection size is larger than R (so we predict the patient dies) but in fact the patient does not die. A false negative error in this case would occur when the resection size is smaller than R (so we predict the patient survives) but in fact the patient dies. Formally, the true positive fraction (TPF) for a specific resection cutoff \\(R\\), is the probability of a positive test (a prediction that the patient will die) among the people who have the outcome died = 1 (those who actually die). \\[ TPF(R) = Pr(resection &gt; R | subject died) \\] Similarly, the false positive fraction (FPF) for a specific cutoff \\(R\\) is the probability of a positive test (prediction that the patient will die) among the people with died = 0 (those who don’t actually die) \\[ FPF(R) = Pr(resection &gt; R | subject did not die) \\] The True Positive Rate is referred to as the sensitivity of a diagnostic test, and the True Negative rate (1 - the False Positive rate) is referred to as the specificity of a diagnostic test. Since the cutoff \\(R\\) is not fixed in advanced, we can plot the value of TPF (on the y axis) against FPF (on the x axis) for all possible values of \\(R\\), and this is what the ROC curve is. Others refer to the Sensitivity on the Y axis, and 1-Specificity on the X axis, and this is the same idea. Before we get too far into the weeds, let me show you some simple situations so you can understand what you might learn from the ROC curve. The web page http://blog.yhat.com/posts/roc-curves.html provides source materials. 13.7.1 Interpreting the Area under the ROC curve The AUC or Area under the ROC curve is the amount of space underneath the ROC curve. Often referred to as the c statistic, the AUC represents the quality of your TPR and FPR overall in a single number. The C statistic ranges from 0 to 1, with C = 0.5 for a prediction that is no better than random guessing, and C = 1 for a perfect prediction model. Next, I’ll build a simulation to demonstrate several possible ROC curves in the sections that follow. set.seed(432999) sim.temp &lt;- data_frame(x = rnorm(n = 200), prob = exp(x)/(1 + exp(x)), y = as.numeric(1 * runif(200) &lt; prob)) sim.temp &lt;- sim.temp %&gt;% mutate(p_guess = 1, p_perfect = y, p_bad = exp(-2*x) / (1 + exp(-2*x)), p_ok = prob + (1-y)*runif(1, 0, 0.05), p_good = prob + y*runif(1, 0, 0.27)) 13.7.1.1 What if we are guessing? If we’re guessing completely at random, then the model should correctly classify a subject (as died or not died) about 50% of the time, so the TPR and FPR will be equal. This yields a diagonal line in the ROC curve, and an area under the curve (C statistic) of 0.5. There are several ways to do this on the web, but I’ll show this one, which has some bizarre code, but that’s a function of using a package called ROCR to do the work. It comes from this link pred_guess &lt;- prediction(sim.temp$p_guess, sim.temp$y) perf_guess &lt;- performance(pred_guess, measure = &quot;tpr&quot;, x.measure = &quot;fpr&quot;) auc_guess &lt;- performance(pred_guess, measure=&quot;auc&quot;) auc_guess &lt;- round(auc_guess@y.values[[1]],3) roc_guess &lt;- data.frame(fpr=unlist(perf_guess@x.values), tpr=unlist(perf_guess@y.values), model=&quot;GLM&quot;) ggplot(roc_guess, aes(x=fpr, ymin=0, ymax=tpr)) + geom_ribbon(alpha=0.2, fill = &quot;blue&quot;) + geom_line(aes(y=tpr), col = &quot;blue&quot;) + labs(title = paste0(&quot;Guessing: ROC Curve w/ AUC=&quot;, auc_guess)) + theme_bw() 13.7.1.2 What if we classify things perfectly? If we’re classifying subjects perfectly, then we have a TPR of 1 and an FPR of 0. That yields an ROC curve that looks like the upper and left edges of a box. If our model correctly classifies a subject (as died or not died) 100% of the time, the area under the curve (c statistic) will be 1.0. We’ll add in the diagonal line here (in a dashed black line) to show how this model compares to random guessing. pred_perf &lt;- prediction(sim.temp$p_perfect, sim.temp$y) perf_perf &lt;- performance(pred_perf, measure = &quot;tpr&quot;, x.measure = &quot;fpr&quot;) auc_perf &lt;- performance(pred_perf, measure=&quot;auc&quot;) auc_perf &lt;- round(auc_perf@y.values[[1]],3) roc_perf &lt;- data.frame(fpr=unlist(perf_perf@x.values), tpr=unlist(perf_perf@y.values), model=&quot;GLM&quot;) ggplot(roc_perf, aes(x=fpr, ymin=0, ymax=tpr)) + geom_ribbon(alpha=0.2, fill = &quot;blue&quot;) + geom_line(aes(y=tpr), col = &quot;blue&quot;) + geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1, lty = &quot;dashed&quot;) + labs(title = paste0(&quot;Perfect Prediction: ROC Curve w/ AUC=&quot;, auc_perf)) + theme_bw() 13.7.1.3 What does “worse than guessing” look like? A bad classifier will appear below and to the right of the diagonal line we’d see if we were completely guessing. Such a model will have a c statistic below 0.5, and will be valueless. pred_bad &lt;- prediction(sim.temp$p_bad, sim.temp$y) perf_bad &lt;- performance(pred_bad, measure = &quot;tpr&quot;, x.measure = &quot;fpr&quot;) auc_bad &lt;- performance(pred_bad, measure=&quot;auc&quot;) auc_bad &lt;- round(auc_bad@y.values[[1]],3) roc_bad &lt;- data.frame(fpr=unlist(perf_bad@x.values), tpr=unlist(perf_bad@y.values), model=&quot;GLM&quot;) ggplot(roc_bad, aes(x=fpr, ymin=0, ymax=tpr)) + geom_ribbon(alpha=0.2, fill = &quot;blue&quot;) + geom_line(aes(y=tpr), col = &quot;blue&quot;) + geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1, lty = &quot;dashed&quot;) + labs(title = paste0(&quot;A Bad Model: ROC Curve w/ AUC=&quot;, auc_bad)) + theme_bw() 13.7.1.4 What does “better than guessing” look like? An “OK” classifier will appear above and to the left of the diagonal line we’d see if we were completely guessing. Such a model will have a c statistic above 0.5, and might have some value. The plot below shows a very fairly poor model, but at least it’s better than guessing. pred_ok &lt;- prediction(sim.temp$p_ok, sim.temp$y) perf_ok &lt;- performance(pred_ok, measure = &quot;tpr&quot;, x.measure = &quot;fpr&quot;) auc_ok &lt;- performance(pred_ok, measure=&quot;auc&quot;) auc_ok &lt;- round(auc_ok@y.values[[1]],3) roc_ok &lt;- data.frame(fpr=unlist(perf_ok@x.values), tpr=unlist(perf_ok@y.values), model=&quot;GLM&quot;) ggplot(roc_ok, aes(x=fpr, ymin=0, ymax=tpr)) + geom_ribbon(alpha=0.2, fill = &quot;blue&quot;) + geom_line(aes(y=tpr), col = &quot;blue&quot;) + geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1, lty = &quot;dashed&quot;) + labs(title = paste0(&quot;A Mediocre Model: ROC Curve w/ AUC=&quot;, auc_ok)) + theme_bw() Sometimes people grasp for a rough guide as to the accuracy of a model’s predictions based on the area under the ROC curve. A common thought is to assess the C statistic much like you would a class grade. C statistic Interpretation 0.90 to 1.00 model does an excellent job at discriminating “yes” from “no” (A) 0.80 to 0.90 model does a good job (B) 0.70 to 0.80 model does a fair job (C) 0.60 to 0.70 model does a poor job (D) 0.50 to 0.60 model fails (F) below 0.50 model is worse than random guessing 13.7.1.5 What does “pretty good” look like? A strong and good classifier will appear above and to the left of the diagonal line we’d see if we were completely guessing, often with a nice curve that is continually increasing and appears to be pulled up towards the top left. Such a model will have a c statistic well above 0.5, but not as large as 1. The plot below shows a stronger model, which appears substantially better than guessing. pred_good &lt;- prediction(sim.temp$p_good, sim.temp$y) perf_good &lt;- performance(pred_good, measure = &quot;tpr&quot;, x.measure = &quot;fpr&quot;) auc_good &lt;- performance(pred_good, measure=&quot;auc&quot;) auc_good &lt;- round(auc_good@y.values[[1]],3) roc_good &lt;- data.frame(fpr=unlist(perf_good@x.values), tpr=unlist(perf_good@y.values), model=&quot;GLM&quot;) ggplot(roc_good, aes(x=fpr, ymin=0, ymax=tpr)) + geom_ribbon(alpha=0.2, fill = &quot;blue&quot;) + geom_line(aes(y=tpr), col = &quot;blue&quot;) + geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1, lty = &quot;dashed&quot;) + labs(title = paste0(&quot;A Pretty Good Model: ROC Curve w/ AUC=&quot;, auc_good)) + theme_bw() 13.8 The ROC Plot for res_modA Let me show you the ROC curve for our res_modA model. ## requires ROCR package prob &lt;- predict(res_modA, resect, type=&quot;response&quot;) pred &lt;- prediction(prob, resect$died) perf &lt;- performance(pred, measure = &quot;tpr&quot;, x.measure = &quot;fpr&quot;) auc &lt;- performance(pred, measure=&quot;auc&quot;) auc &lt;- round(auc@y.values[[1]],3) roc.data &lt;- data.frame(fpr=unlist(perf@x.values), tpr=unlist(perf@y.values), model=&quot;GLM&quot;) ggplot(roc.data, aes(x=fpr, ymin=0, ymax=tpr)) + geom_ribbon(alpha=0.2, fill = &quot;blue&quot;) + geom_line(aes(y=tpr), col = &quot;blue&quot;) + geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1, lty = &quot;dashed&quot;) + labs(title = paste0(&quot;ROC Curve w/ AUC=&quot;, auc)) + theme_bw() Based on the C statistic (AUC = 0.771) this would rank somewhere near the high end of a “fair” predictive model by this standard, not quite to the level of a “good” model. 13.8.1 Another way to plot the ROC Curve If we’ve loaded the pROC package, we can also use the following (admittedly simpler) approach to plot the ROC curve, without ggplot2, and to obtain the C statistic, and a 95% confidence interval around that C statistic. ## requires pROC package roc.modA &lt;- roc(resect$died ~ predict(res_modA, type=&quot;response&quot;), ci = TRUE) roc.modA Call: roc.formula(formula = resect$died ~ predict(res_modA, type = &quot;response&quot;), ci = TRUE) Data: predict(res_modA, type = &quot;response&quot;) in 117 controls (resect$died 0) &lt; 17 cases (resect$died 1). Area under the curve: 0.7707 95% CI: 0.67-0.8715 (DeLong) plot(roc.modA) 13.9 Assessing Residual Plots from Model A Residuals are certainly less informative for logistic regression than they are for linear regression: not only do yes/no outcomes inherently contain less information than continuous ones, but the fact that the adjusted response depends on the fit hampers our ability to use residuals as external checks on the model. This is mitigated to some extent, however, by the fact that we are also making fewer distributional assumptions in logistic regression, so there is no need to inspect residuals for, say, skewness or heteroskedasticity. Patrick Breheny, University of Kentucky, Slides on GLM Residuals and Diagnostics The usual residual plots are available in R for a logistic regression model, but most of them are irrelevant in the logistic regression setting. The residuals shouldn’t follow a standard Normal distribution, and they will not show constant variance over the range of the predictor variables, so plots looking into those issues aren’t helpful. The only plot from the standard set that we’ll look at in many settings is plot 5, which helps us assess influence (via Cook’s distance contours), and a measure related to leverage (how unusual an observation is in terms of the predictors) and standardized Pearson residuals. plot(res_modA, which = 5) In this case, I don’t see any highly influential points, as no points fall outside of the Cook’s distance (0.5 or 1) contours. 13.10 Model B: A “Kitchen Sink” Logistic Regression Model res_modB &lt;- glm(died ~ resection + age + prior + intubated, data = resect, family = binomial) res_modB Call: glm(formula = died ~ resection + age + prior + intubated, family = binomial, data = resect) Coefficients: (Intercept) resection age prior intubated -5.152886 0.612211 0.001173 0.814691 2.810797 Degrees of Freedom: 133 Total (i.e. Null); 129 Residual Null Deviance: 101.9 Residual Deviance: 67.36 AIC: 77.36 13.10.1 Comparing Model A to Model B anova(res_modA, res_modB) Analysis of Deviance Table Model 1: died ~ resection Model 2: died ~ resection + age + prior + intubated Resid.

We also have at least 6 big “misses” among the 17 subjects who actually died. 13.11.3 The ROC curve for Model B ## requires ROCR package prob &lt;- predict(res_modB, resect, type=&quot;response&quot;) pred &lt;- prediction(prob, resect$died) perf &lt;- performance(pred, measure = &quot;tpr&quot;, x.measure = &quot;fpr&quot;) auc &lt;- performance(pred, measure=&quot;auc&quot;) auc &lt;- round(auc@y.values[[1]],3) roc.data &lt;- data.frame(fpr=unlist(perf@x.values), tpr=unlist(perf@y.values), model=&quot;GLM&quot;) ggplot(roc.data, aes(x=fpr, ymin=0, ymax=tpr)) + geom_ribbon(alpha=0.2, fill = &quot;blue&quot;) + geom_line(aes(y=tpr), col = &quot;blue&quot;) + geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1, lty = &quot;dashed&quot;) + labs(title = paste0(&quot;Model B: ROC Curve w/ AUC=&quot;, auc)) + theme_bw() The area under the curve (C-statistic) is 0.86, which certainly looks like a more discriminating fit than model A with resection alone. 13.11.4 Residuals, Leverage and Influence plot(res_modB, which = 5) Again, we see no signs of deeply influential points in this model. 13.12 Logistic Regression using lrm To obtain the Nagelkerke \\(R^2\\) and the C statistic, as well as some other summaries, I’ll now demonstrate the use of lrm from the rms package to fit a logistic regression model.

Also specified is the maximum absolute value of the derivative at the point where the maximum likelihood function was estimated. I wouldn’t worry about that practically, as all you will care about is whether the iterative function-fitting process converged, and R will warn you in other ways if it doesn’t. A likelihood ratio test (drop in deviance test) subtracting the residual deviance from the null deviance obtain the Likelihood Ratio \\(\\chi^2\\) statistic, subtracting residual df from null df to obtain degrees of freedom, and comparing the resulting test statistic to a \\(\\chi^2\\) distribution with the appropriate degrees of freedom to determine a p value. A series of discrimination indexes, including the Nagelkerke R2, symbolized R2, and several others we’ll discuss shortly. A series of rank discrimination indexes, including the C statistic (area under the ROC curve) and Somers’ D (Dxy), and several others. A table of coefficients, standard errors, Wald Z statistics and p values based on those Wald statistics. The C statistic is estimated to be 0.771, with an associated (Nagelkerke) \\(R^2\\) = 0.167, both indicating at best mediocre performance for this model, as it turns out. 13.12.1 Interpreting Nagelkerke R2 There are many ways to calculate \\(R^2\\) for logistic regression. At the unfortunate URL linked here (unfortunate because the term “pseudo” is misspelled) there is a nice summary of the key issue, which is that there are at least three different ways to think about \\(R^2\\) in linear regression that are equivalent in that context, but when you move to a categorical outcome, which interpretation you use leads you down a different path for extension to the new type of outcome. Paul Allison, for instance, describes several at this link in a post entitled “What’s the Best R-Squared for Logistic Regression?” Jonathan Bartlett looks at McFadden’s pseudo \\(R^2\\) in some detail (including some R code) at this link, in a post entitled “R squared in logistic regression” The Nagelkerke approach that is presented as R2 in the lrm output is as good as most of the available approaches, and has the positive feature that it does reach 1 if the fitted model shows as much improvement as possible over the null model (which predicts the mean response for all subjects, and has R2 = 0). The greater the improvement, the higher the Nagelkerke R2. For model A, our Nagelkerke R2 = 0.167, which is pretty poor. It doesn’t technically mean that 16.7% of any sort of variation has been explained, though. 13.12.2 Interpreting the C statistic and Plotting the ROC Curve The C statistic is a measure of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. This link has some nice material that provides some insight into the C statistic and ROC curve. Recall that C ranges from 0 to 1. 0 = BAD, 1 = GOOD. values of C less than 0.5 indicate that your prediction model is not even as good as simple random guessing of “yes” or “no” for your response. C = 0.5 for random guessing C = 1 indicates a perfect classification scheme - one that correctly guesses “yes” for all “yes” patients, and for none of the “no” patients. The closer C is to 1, the happier we’ll be, most of the time. Often we’ll call models with 0.5 &lt; C &lt; 0.8 poor or weak in terms of predictive ability by this measure 0.8 \\(\\leq\\) C &lt; 0.9 are moderately strong in terms of predictive power (indicate good discrimination) C \\(\\geq\\) 0.9 usually indicates a very strong model in this regard (indicate excellent discrimination) We’ve seen the ROC curve for this model before, when we looked at model res_modA fitted using glm in the previous chapter. But, just for completeness, I’ll include it. Note. I change the initial predict call from type = &quot;response&quot; for a glm fit to type = &quot;fitted&quot; in a lrm fit. Otherwise, this is the same approach. ## requires ROCR package prob &lt;- predict(res_modC, resect, type=&quot;fitted&quot;) pred &lt;- prediction(prob, resect$died) perf &lt;- performance(pred, measure = &quot;tpr&quot;, x.measure = &quot;fpr&quot;) auc &lt;- performance(pred, measure=&quot;auc&quot;) auc &lt;- round(auc@y.values[[1]],3) roc.data &lt;- data.frame(fpr=unlist(perf@x.values), tpr=unlist(perf@y.values), model=&quot;GLM&quot;) ggplot(roc.data, aes(x=fpr, ymin=0, ymax=tpr)) + geom_ribbon(alpha=0.2, fill = &quot;blue&quot;) + geom_line(aes(y=tpr), col = &quot;blue&quot;) + geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1, lty = &quot;dashed&quot;) + labs(title = paste0(&quot;Model C: ROC Curve w/ AUC=&quot;, auc)) + theme_bw() 13.12.3 The C statistic and Somers’ D The C statistic is directly related to Somers’ D statistic, abbreviated \\(D_{xy}\\), by the equation C = 0.5 + (D/2). Somers’ D and the ROC area only measure how well predicted values from the model can rank-order the responses. For example, predicted probabilities of 0.01 and 0.99 for a pair of subjects are no better than probabilities of 0.2 and 0.8 using rank measures, if the first subject had a lower response value than the second. Thus, the C statistic (or \\(D_{xy}\\)) may not be very sensitive ways to choose between models, even though they provide reasonable summaries of the models individually. This is especially true when the models are strong. The Nagelkerke R2 may be more sensitive. But as it turns out, we sometimes have to look at the ROC shapes, as the summary statistic alone isn’t enough. In our case, Somers D (Dxy) = .541, so the C statistic is 0.771. 13.12.4 Validating the Logistic Regression Model Summary Statistics Like other regression-fitting tools in rms, the lrm function has a special validate tool to help perform resampling validation of a model, with or without backwards step-wise variable selection. Here, we’ll validate our model’s summary statistics using 100 bootstrap replications. set.seed(432001) validate(res_modC, B = 100) index.orig training test optimism index.corrected n Dxy 0.5415 0.5325 0.5415 -0.0090 0.5505 100 R2 0.1666 0.1664 0.1666 -0.0002 0.1668 100 Intercept 0.0000 0.0000 0.1425 -0.1425 0.1425 100 Slope 1.0000 1.0000 1.0742 -0.0742 1.0742 100 Emax 0.0000 0.0000 0.0416 0.0416 0.0416 100 D 0.0854 0.0872 0.0854 0.0017 0.0837 100 U -0.0149 -0.0149 -0.0004 -0.0145 -0.0004 100 Q 0.1004 0.1021 0.0859 0.0162 0.0841 100 B 0.1025 0.1032 0.1046 -0.0014 0.1039 100 g 1.0369 1.0247 1.0369 -0.0122 1.0491 100 gp 0.1101 0.1082 0.1101 -0.0019 0.1119 100 Recall that our area under the curve (C statistic) = 0.5 + (Dxy/2), so that we can also use the first row of statistics to validate the C statistic. Accounting for optimism in this manner, our corrected estimates are Dxy = 0.551, so C = 0.776, and Nagelkerke R2 = 0.167. 13.12.5 Plotting the Summary of the lrm approach The summary function applied to an lrm fit shows the effect size comparing the 25th to the 75th percentile of resection. plot(summary(res_modC)) summary(res_modC) Effects Response : died Factor Low High Diff.

Note the linear effect of resection size on the log odds scale. ggplot(Predict(res_modC)) By applying the plogis function within the Predict command, we can plot the effect of resection on the estimated probability of death. Note the non-linear effect on this probability in this logistic regression model. ggplot(Predict(res_modC, fun = plogis)) + labs(y = &quot;Predicted probability from Model C&quot;, title = &quot;Model C with the resect data&quot;) The Predict function itself provides the raw material being captured in this plot. head(Predict(res_modC, fun = plogis)) resection yhat lower upper .predictor. resection.1 1.000000 0.02431476 0.006636502 0.08505223 resection resection.2 1.020101 0.02467096 0.006789313 0.08559056 resection resection.3 1.040201 0.02503224 0.006945549 0.08613277 resection resection.4 1.060302 0.02539867 0.007105283 0.08667889 resection resection.5 1.080402 0.02577033 0.007268589 0.08722896 resection resection.6 1.100503 0.02614728 0.007435542 0.08778304 resection Response variable (y): Limits are 0.95 confidence limits 13.12.7 ANOVA from the lrm approach anova(res_modC) Wald Statistics Response: died Factor Chi-Square d.f. P resection 11.07 1 9e-04 TOTAL 11.07 1 9e-04 The ANOVA approach applied to a lrm fit provides a Wald test for the model as a whole. Here, the use of resection is a significant improvement over a null (intercept-only) model. The p value is 9 x 10-4. 13.12.8 Are any points particularly influential? I’ll use a cutoff for dfbeta here of 0.3, instead of the default 0.2, because I want to focus on truly influential points. Note that we have to use the data frame version of resect as show.influence isn’t tibble-friendly. inf.C &lt;- which.influence(res_modC, cutoff=0.3) inf.C $Intercept [1] &quot;84&quot; &quot;128&quot; $resection [1] &quot;84&quot; show.influence(object = inf.C, dframe = data.frame(resect)) Count resection 84 2 *2.0 128 1 2.5 It appears that observation 84 may have a meaningful effect on both the intercept and the coefficient for resection. 13.12.9 A Nomogram for Model C We use the plogis function within a nomogram call to get R to produce fitted probabilities (of our outcome, died) in this case. plot(nomogram(res_modC, fun=plogis, fun.at=c(0.05, seq(0.1, 0.9, by = 0.1), 0.95), funlabel=&quot;Pr(died)&quot;)) Since there’s no non-linearity in the right hand side of our simple logistic regression model, the nomogram is straightforward. We calculate the points based on the resection by traveling up, and then travel down in a straight vertical line from total points through the linear (log odds) predictor straight to a fitted probability. Note that fitted probabilities above 0.5 are not possible within the range of observed resection values in this case. 13.13 Model D: An Augmented Kitchen Sink Model Can we predict survival from the patient’s age, whether the patient had prior tracheal surgery or not, the extent of the resection, and whether intubation was required at the end of surgery? 13.13.1 Spearman \\(\\rho^2\\) Plot Let’s start by considering the limited use of non-linear terms for predictors that look important in a Spearman \\(\\rho^2\\) plot. plot(spearman2(died ~ age + prior + resection + intubated, data=resect)) The most important variable appears to be whether intubation was required, so I’ll include intubated’s interaction with the linear effect of the next most (apparently) important variable, resection, and also a cubic spline for resection, with three knots. Since prior and age look less important, I’ll simply add them as linear terms. 13.13.2 Fitting Model D using lrm Note the use of %ia% here. This insures that only the linear part of the resection term will be used in the interaction with intubated. dd &lt;- datadist(resect) options(datadist=&quot;dd&quot;) res_modD &lt;- lrm(died ~ age + prior + rcs(resection, 3) + intubated + intubated %ia% resection, data=resect, x=TRUE, y=TRUE) 13.13.3 Assessing Model D using lrm’s tools res_modD Logistic Regression Model lrm(formula = died ~ age + prior + rcs(resection, 3) + intubated + intubated %ia% resection, data = resect, x = TRUE, y = TRUE) Model Likelihood Discrimination Rank Discrim.

The Nagelkerke R2 of 0.46, and the C statistic of 0.88 indicate a meaningful improvement in discrimination over our model with resection alone. The Wald Z tests see some potential need to prune the model, as none of the elements reaches statistical significance without the others. The product term between intubated and resection, in particular, doesn’t appear to have helped much, once we already had the main effects. 13.13.4 ANOVA and Wald Tests for Model D anova(res_modD) Wald Statistics Response: died Factor Chi-Square d.f. age 0.00 1 prior 0.72 1 resection (Factor+Higher Order Factors) 4.95 3 All Interactions 0.72 1 Nonlinear 2.43 1 intubated (Factor+Higher Order Factors) 16.45 2 All Interactions 0.72 1 intubated * resection (Factor+Higher Order Factors) 0.72 1 TOTAL NONLINEAR + INTERACTION 2.56 2 TOTAL 23.90 6 P 0.9988 0.3947 0.1753 0.3970 0.1194 0.0003 0.3970 0.3970 0.2783 0.0005 Neither the interaction term nor the non-linearity from the cubic spline appears to be statistically significant, based on the Wald tests via ANOVA.

The odds ratio for death isn’t significantly different from 1 for any variable, but the impact of resection and intubated, though not strong enough to be significant, look more substantial (if poorly estimated) than the effects of age and prior. 13.13.6 Plot In-Sample Predictions for Model D Here are plots of the effects across the range of each predictor (holding the others constant) on the log odds scale. Note the non-linear effect of resection implied by the use of a spline there. ggplot(Predict(res_modD)) We can also capture and plot these results on the probability scale, as follows9. ggplot(Predict(res_modD, fun = plogis)) 13.13.7 Plotting the ROC curve for Model D Again, remember to use type = &quot;fitted&quot; with a lrm fit. ## requires ROCR package prob &lt;- predict(res_modD, resect, type=&quot;fitted&quot;) pred &lt;- prediction(prob, resect$died) perf &lt;- performance(pred, measure = &quot;tpr&quot;, x.measure = &quot;fpr&quot;) auc &lt;- performance(pred, measure=&quot;auc&quot;) auc &lt;- round(auc@y.values[[1]],3) roc.data &lt;- data.frame(fpr=unlist(perf@x.values), tpr=unlist(perf@y.values), model=&quot;GLM&quot;) ggplot(roc.data, aes(x=fpr, ymin=0, ymax=tpr)) + geom_ribbon(alpha=0.2, fill = &quot;blue&quot;) + geom_line(aes(y=tpr), col = &quot;blue&quot;) + geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1, lty = &quot;dashed&quot;) + labs(title = paste0(&quot;ROC Curve w/ AUC=&quot;, auc)) + theme_bw() The AUC fitted with ROCR (0.883) is slightly different than what lrm has told us (0.880), and this also happens if we use the pROC approach, demonstrated below. ## requires pROC package roc.modD &lt;- roc(resect$died ~ predict(res_modD, type=&quot;fitted&quot;), ci = TRUE) roc.modD Call: roc.formula(formula = resect$died ~ predict(res_modD, type = &quot;fitted&quot;), ci = TRUE) Data: predict(res_modD, type = &quot;fitted&quot;) in 117 controls (resect$died 0) &lt; 17 cases (resect$died 1).

Based on the anova for model D and the Spearman rho-squared plot, it appears that a two-predictor model using intubation and resection may be sufficient. Neither of the other potential predictors shows a statistically detectable effect in its Wald test. res_modE &lt;- lrm(died ~ intubated + resection, data=resect, x=TRUE, y=TRUE) res_modE Logistic Regression Model lrm(formula = died ~ intubated + resection, data = resect, x = TRUE, y = TRUE) Model Likelihood Discrimination Rank Discrim.

This implies that: for intubated patients, the equation is -1.773 + 0.548 resection, while for non-intubated patients, the equation is -4.637 + 0.548 resection. We can use the ilogit function within the faraway package to help plot this. 13.14.1 A Plot comparing the two intubation groups ggplot(resect, aes(x = resection, y = died, col = factor(intubated))) + scale_color_manual(values = c(&quot;blue&quot;, &quot;red&quot;)) + geom_jitter(size = 2, height = 0.1) + geom_line(aes(x = resection, y = faraway::ilogit(-4.637 + 0.548*resection)), col = &quot;blue&quot;) + geom_line(aes(x = resection, y = faraway::ilogit(-1.773 + 0.548*resection)), col = &quot;red&quot;) + geom_text(x = 4, y = 0.2, label = &quot;Not Intubated&quot;, col=&quot;blue&quot;) + geom_text(x = 2.5, y = 0.6, label = &quot;Intubated Patients&quot;, col=&quot;red&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;Extent of Resection (in cm.)&quot;, y = &quot;Death (1,0) and estimated probability of death&quot;, title = &quot;resect data, Model E&quot;) The effect of intubation appears to be very large, compared to the resection size effect. 13.14.2 Nomogram for Model E A nomogram of the model would help, too. plot(nomogram(res_modE, fun=plogis, fun.at=c(0.05, seq(0.1, 0.9, by=0.1), 0.95), funlabel=&quot;Pr(died)&quot;)) Again, we see that the effect of intubation is enormous, compared to the effect of resection.

Model D does a little better in one direction (94.17% of those predicted by Model D to be alive actually survived) but worse in the other (71.43% of those predicted by Model D to die actually died.) Model C does worse than each of the others in both predicting those who survive and those who die. Note that the approaches discussed here would be useful if we had a new sample to predict on, as well. We could then compare the errors for that new data made by this sort of classification scheme either graphically or in a table. 13.16 Conclusions It appears that intubated status and, to a lesser degree, the extent of the resection both play a meaningful role in predicting death associated with tracheal carina resection surgery. Patients who are intubated are associated with worse outcomes (greater risk of death) and more extensive resections are also associated with worse outcomes. References "],

As we’ve discussed in previous work, the variables in the smartcle1.csv file are listed below, along with (in some cases) the BRFSS items that generate these responses. Variable Description SEQNO respondent identification number (all begin with 2016) physhealth Now thinking about your physical health, which includes physical illness and injury, for how many days during the past 30 days was your physical health not good? menthealth Now thinking about your mental health, which includes stress, depression, and problems with emotions, for how many days during the past 30 days was your mental health not good? poorhealth During the past 30 days, for about how many days did poor physical or mental health keep you from doing your usual activities, such as self-care, work, or recreation? genhealth Would you say that in general, your health is … (five categories: Excellent, Very Good, Good, Fair or Poor) bmi Body mass index, in kg/m2 female Sex, 1 = female, 0 = male internet30 Have you used the internet in the past 30 days? (1 = yes, 0 = no) exerany During the past month, other than your regular job, did you participate in any physical activities or exercises such as running, calisthenics, golf, gardening, or walking for exercise? (1 = yes, 0 = no) sleephrs On average, how many hours of sleep do you get in a 24-hour period? alcdays How many days during the past 30 days did you have at least one drink of any alcoholic beverage such as beer, wine, a malt beverage or liquor? In this section, we’ll use some of the variables described above to predict the binary outcome: exerany. 14.2 Thinking About Non-Linear Terms We have enough observations here to consider some non-linearity for our model. In addition, since the genhealth variable is an ordinal variable and multi-categorical, we should consider how to model it. We have three options: include it as a factor in the model (the default approach) build a numeric version of that variable, and then restrict our model to treat that numeric variable as ordinal (forcing the categories to affect the exerany probabilities in an ordinal way), rather than as a simple nominal factor (so that if the effect of fair vs. good was to decrease the probability of ‘exerany’, then the effect of poor vs. good would have to decrease the probability at least as much as fair vs. good did.) Treating the genhealth variable as ordinal could be accomplished with the scored function in the rms package. build a numeric version of genhealth and then use the catg function to specify the predictor as nominal and categorical, but this will lead to essentially the same model as choice 1. Suppose we’ve decided to treat the genhealth data as categorical, without restricting the effect of its various levels to be ordinal. Suppose also that we’ve decided to include the following seven variables in our model for exerany: physhealth menthealth genhealth bmi female internet30 sleephrs Suppose we have a subject matter understanding that: the impact of bmi on exerany is affected by female, so we plan a female x bmi interaction term we’re using internet30 as a proxy for poverty, and we think that an interaction with self-reported genhealth will be helpful in our model as well. Note that we do have some missing values in some of these predictors, so we’ll have to deal with that soon. smartcle1 %&gt;% select(exerany, physhealth, menthealth, genhealth, bmi, female, internet30, sleephrs) %&gt;% skim() Skim summary statistics n obs: 1036 n variables: 8 Variable type: factor variable missing complete n n_unique genhealth 3 1033 1036 5 top_counts ordered 2_V: 350, 3_G: 344, 1_E: 173, 4_F: 122 FALSE Variable type: integer variable missing complete n mean sd p0 p25 median p75 p100 exerany 3 1033 1036 0.76 0.43 0 1 1 1 1 female 0 1036 1036 0.6 0.49 0 0 1 1 1 internet30 6 1030 1036 0.81 0.39 0 1 1 1 1 menthealth 11 1025 1036 2.72 6.82 0 0 0 2 30 physhealth 17 1019 1036 3.97 8.67 0 0 0 2 30 sleephrs 8 1028 1036 7.02 1.53 1 6 7 8 20 Variable type: numeric variable missing complete n mean sd p0 p25 median p75 p100 bmi 84 952 1036 27.89 6.47 12.71 23.7 26.68 30.53 66.06 14.3 A First Model for exerany (Complete Case Analysis) Suppose we develop a main-effects kitchen sink model (model m1 below) fitted to these predictors without the benefit of any non-linear terms except the two pre-planned interactions.

Since we’re already planning some interaction terms, I’ll keep them in mind as I look at this plot. sp_smart &lt;- spearman2(exerany ~ physhealth + menthealth + genhealth + internet30 + bmi + female + sleephrs, data = smartcle1) plot(sp_smart) We see that the best candidate for a non-linear term is the genhealth variable, according to this plot, followed by the physhealth and internet30 predictors, then bmi. I will wind up fitting a model including the following non-linear terms… our pre-planned female x bmi and internet30 x genhealth interaction terms, a new genhealth x physhealth interaction term, a restricted cubic spline with 5 knots for physhealth a restricted cubic spline with 4 knots for bmi (so the interaction term with female will need to account for this and restrict our interaction to the linear piece of bmi) 14.5 A Second Model for exerany (Complete Cases) Here’s the resulting model fit without worrying about imputation yet. This is just to make sure our code works. Note that I’m inserting the main effects of our interaction terms explicitly before including the interaction terms themselves, and that I need to use %ia% to include the interaction terms where one of the terms is included in the model with a spline. Again, I won’t draw any serious conclusions yet. m2 &lt;- lrm(exerany ~ rcs(bmi, 4) + rcs(physhealth, 5) + female + internet30 * genhealth + genhealth %ia% physhealth + female %ia% bmi + menthealth + sleephrs, data = smartcle1) m2 Frequencies of Missing Values Due to Each Variable exerany bmi physhealth female internet30 genhealth 3 84 17 0 6 3 menthealth sleephrs 11 8 Logistic Regression Model lrm(formula = exerany ~ rcs(bmi, 4) + rcs(physhealth, 5) + female + internet30 * genhealth + genhealth %ia% physhealth + female %ia% bmi + menthealth + sleephrs, data = smartcle1) Model Likelihood Discrimination Rank Discrim.

I will proceed as follows: Omit all cases where the outcome exerany is missing. Determine (and plot) the remaining missingness. Use simple imputation for all predictors, and build a new data set with “complete” data. Re-fit the proposed models using this new data set. 14.6.1 Omit cases where the outcome is missing We need to drop the cases where exerany is missing in smartcle1. We’ll begin creating an imputed data set, called smartcle_imp0, by filtering on complete data for exerany, as follows. Hmisc::describe(smartcle1$exerany) smartcle1$exerany n missing distinct Info Sum Mean Gmd 1033 3 2 0.546 786 0.7609 0.3642 smartcle_imp0 &lt;- smartcle1 %&gt;% filter(complete.cases(exerany)) %&gt;% select(SEQNO, exerany, physhealth, menthealth, genhealth, bmi, female, internet30, sleephrs) Hmisc::describe(smartcle_imp0$exerany) smartcle_imp0$exerany n missing distinct Info Sum Mean Gmd 1033 0 2 0.546 786 0.7609 0.3642 14.6.2 Plot the remaining missingness We’ll look at the missing values (excluding the subject ID: SEQNO) in our new data set. Of course, we can get a count of missing values within each variable with skim or with: colSums(is.na(smartcle_imp0)) SEQNO exerany physhealth menthealth genhealth bmi 0 0 16 11 3 83 female internet30 sleephrs 0 6 7 The Hmisc package has a plotting approach which can help identify missingness, too. naplot(naclus(select(smartcle_imp0, -SEQNO))) We can also get a useful accounting of missing data patterns, with the md.pattern function in the mice package. mice::md.pattern(smartcle_imp0) SEQNO exerany female genhealth internet30 sleephrs menthealth 924 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 76 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 4 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 3 6 7 11 physhealth bmi 924 1 1 0 8 0 1 1 6 1 1 1 76 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 4 1 1 1 3 0 1 2 1 1 1 2 1 0 0 2 4 1 0 2 1 0 1 2 1 1 0 2 1 0 1 3 1 0 0 3 1 0 1 3 16 83 126 We can also do this with na.pattern in the Hmisc package, but then we have to get the names of the columns, too, so that we can read off the values. na.pattern(smartcle_imp0) pattern 000000000 000000001 000000010 000001000 000001001 000001010 000100000 924 4 1 76 1 4 6 000110000 001000000 001000001 001001000 001001010 001010001 001100000 1 8 1 1 1 1 3 001110000 1 names(smartcle_imp0) [1] &quot;SEQNO&quot; &quot;exerany&quot; &quot;physhealth&quot; &quot;menthealth&quot; &quot;genhealth&quot; [6] &quot;bmi&quot; &quot;female&quot; &quot;internet30&quot; &quot;sleephrs&quot; 14.6.3 Use simple imputation, build a new data set The only variables that require no imputation are exerany and female.

The sensible things to interpret are the odds ratios. holding all other predictors constant, the effect of moving from internet30 = 0 to internet30 = 1 is that the odds of exerany increase by a factor of 2.77. Suppose Harry and Steve have the same values of all predictors in this model except that Harry used the internet and Steve did not. So the odds of exercising for Harry (who used the internet) are 2.77 times higher than the odds of exercising for Steve (who didn’t use the internet), assuming that all other predictors are the same. We also have a 95% confidence interval for this odds ratio, which is (1.26, 6.07). Since 1 is not in that interval, the data don’t seem to be consistent with internet30 having no effect on exerany. the odds ratio comparing two subjects with the same predictors except that Harry has a BMI of 30.31 (the 75th percentile of observed BMIs in our sample) and Marty has a BMI of 23.9 (the 25th percentile) is that Harry has 0.767 times the odds of exercising that Marty does. So Harry’s probability of exercise will also be lower than Marty’s. The 95% confidence interval in this case is (0.58, 1.01), and because 1 is in that interval, we cannot conclude that the effect of bmi meets the standard for statistical significance at the 5% level. A similar approach can be used to describe the odds ratios associated with each predictor. Note that each of the categories in genh_n is compared to a single baseline category. Here, that’s category 2. R will pick the modal category: the one that appears most often in the data. The comparisons of each category against category 2 are not significant in each case, at the 5% level. 14.7.4 Plotting the Model with ggplot and Predict Let’s look at a series of plots describing the model on the probability scale. ggplot(Predict(m1_a, fun = plogis)) This helps us describe what is happening in terms of direction at least. For example, As bmi increases, predicted Pr(exerany) decreases. People who accessed the internet in the past 30 days have higher model probabilities of exercising. Do any of these plots fail to make sense to you? Is anything moving in a surprising direction? 14.7.5 Plotting the model with a nomogram plot(nomogram(m1_a, fun = plogis)) Note the impact of our interaction terms, and how we have two lines for bmi and five lines for internet30 that come out of our product terms. As with any nomogram, to make a prediction we: find the values of each of our predictors in the scales, and travel vertically up to the Points line to read off the Points for that predictor. sum up the Points across all predictors, and find that location in the Total Points line. move vertically down from the total points line to find the estimated “linear predictor” (log odds ratio) and finally the “predicted value” (probability of our outcome exerany = 1.) 14.7.6 Checking the Goodness of Fit of our model To test the goodness of fit, we can use the following omnibus test: round(residuals(m1_a, type = &quot;gof&quot;),3) Sum of squared errors Expected value|H0 SD 158.955 158.740 0.525 Z P 0.408 0.683 Our non-significant p value suggests that we cannot detect anything that’s obviously wrong in the model in terms of goodness of fit. That’s comforting. 14.8 Refitting Model 2 with simply imputed data I’ll walk through the same tasks for Model m2 that I did above for Model m1. Again, we’re running this model after simple imputation of missing values. Using the numeric version of the genhealth data, called genh_n, will ease the reviewing of later output, so we’ll do that here, making sure R knows that genh_n describes a categorical factor. d &lt;- datadist(smartcle_imp1) options(datadist = &quot;d&quot;) m2_a &lt;- lrm(exerany ~ rcs(bmi, 4) + rcs(physhealth, 5) + female + internet30 * catg(genh_n) + catg(genh_n) %ia% physhealth + female %ia% bmi + menthealth + sleephrs, data = smartcle_imp1, x = TRUE, y = TRUE) m2_a Logistic Regression Model lrm(formula = exerany ~ rcs(bmi, 4) + rcs(physhealth, 5) + female + internet30 * catg(genh_n) + catg(genh_n) %ia% physhealth + female %ia% bmi + menthealth + sleephrs, data = smartcle_imp1, x = TRUE, y = TRUE) Model Likelihood Discrimination Rank Discrim.

The sensible things to interpret are the odds ratios. For example, holding all other predictors constant, the effect of moving from internet30 = 0 to internet30 = 1 is that the odds of exerany increase by a factor of 2.80. the odds ratio comparing two subjects with the same predictors except that Harry has a BMI of 30.31 (the 75th percentile of observed BMIs in our sample) and Marty has a BMI of 23.9 (the 25th percentile) is that Harry has 0.619 times the odds of exercising that Marty does. So Harry’s probability of exercise will also be lower. By sex, which group has a larger probability of exerany, holding all other predictors constant, by this model? Females or Males? 14.8.4 Plotting the Model with ggplot and Predict Again, consider a series of plots describing the model m2_a on the probability scale. ggplot(Predict(m2_a, fun = plogis)) Note the small kink in the bmi plot. To what do you attribute this? 14.8.5 Plotting the model with a nomogram plot(nomogram(m2_a, fun = plogis)) Note the impact of our interaction terms, and the cubic splines in bmi and physhealth. As with any nomogram, to make a prediction we: find the values of each of our predictors in the scales, and travel vertically up to the Points line to read off the Points for that predictor. sum up the Points across all predictors, and find that location in the Total Points line. move vertically down from the total points line to find the estimated “linear predictor” (log odds ratio) and finally the “predicted value” (probability of our outcome exerany = 1.) 14.8.6 Checking the Goodness of Fit of our model To test the goodness of fit, we can use the following omnibus test: round(residuals(m2_a, type = &quot;gof&quot;),3) Sum of squared errors Expected value|H0 SD 157.102 157.011 0.522 Z P 0.174 0.862 Our non-significant p value suggests that we cannot detect anything that’s obviously wrong in the model in terms of goodness of fit. 14.9 Comparing Model 2 to Model 1 after simple imputation We can refit the models with glm and then compare them with anova, aic and bic approaches, if we like. m1_a_glm &lt;- glm(exerany ~ internet30 * factor(genh_n) + bmi * female + physhealth + menthealth + sleephrs, data = smartcle_imp1, family = binomial) m2_a_glm &lt;- glm(exerany ~ rcs(bmi, 4) + rcs(physhealth, 5) + female + internet30 * factor(genh_n) + factor(genh_n) %ia% physhealth + female %ia% bmi + menthealth + sleephrs, data = smartcle_imp1, family = binomial) 14.9.1 Comparison by Analysis of Deviance anova(m1_a_glm, m2_a_glm) Analysis of Deviance Table Model 1: exerany ~ internet30 * factor(genh_n) + bmi * female + physhealth + menthealth + sleephrs Model 2: exerany ~ rcs(bmi, 4) + rcs(physhealth, 5) + female + internet30 * factor(genh_n) + factor(genh_n) %ia% physhealth + female %ia% bmi + menthealth + sleephrs Resid.

The steps for this work are as follows: aregImpute draws a sample with replacement from the observations where the target variable is observed, not missing. aregImpute then fits a flexible additive model to predict this target variable while finding the optimum transformation of it. aregImpute then uses this fitted flexible model to predict the target variable in all of the original observations. Finally, aregImpute imputes each missing value of the target variable with the observed value whose predicted transformed value is closest to the predicted transformed value of the missing value. We’ll start with the smartcle_imp0 data set, which contains only the subjects in the original smartcle1 data where exerany is available, and which includes only the variables of interest to us, including both the factor (genhealth) and numeric (genh_n) versions of the genhealth data. summary(smartcle_imp0) SEQNO exerany physhealth menthealth Min. :2.016e+09 Min. :0.0000 Min. : 0.000 Min. : 0.000 1st Qu.:2.016e+09 1st Qu.:1.0000 1st Qu.: 0.000 1st Qu.: 0.000 Median :2.016e+09 Median :1.0000 Median : 0.000 Median : 0.000 Mean :2.016e+09 Mean :0.7609 Mean : 3.949 Mean : 2.701 3rd Qu.:2.016e+09 3rd Qu.:1.0000 3rd Qu.: 2.000 3rd Qu.: 2.000 Max. :2.016e+09 Max. :1.0000 Max. :30.000 Max. :30.000 NA&#39;s :16 NA&#39;s :11 genhealth bmi female internet30 1_Excellent:172 Min. :12.71 Min. :0.0000 Min. :0.0000 2_VeryGood :350 1st Qu.:23.70 1st Qu.:0.0000 1st Qu.:1.0000 3_Good :344 Median :26.68 Median :1.0000 Median :1.0000 4_Fair :121 Mean :27.85 Mean :0.6012 Mean :0.8101 5_Poor : 43 3rd Qu.:30.53 3rd Qu.:1.0000 3rd Qu.:1.0000 NA&#39;s : 3 Max. :66.06 Max. :1.0000 Max. :1.0000 NA&#39;s :83 NA&#39;s :6 sleephrs genh_n Min. : 1.000 Min. :1.000 1st Qu.: 6.000 1st Qu.:2.000 Median : 7.000 Median :2.000 Mean : 7.022 Mean :2.527 3rd Qu.: 8.000 3rd Qu.:3.000 Max. :20.000 Max. :5.000 NA&#39;s :7 NA&#39;s :3 The smartcle_imp0 data set contains 1033 rows (subjects) and 10 columns (variables.) 14.10.1 Using aregImpute to fit a multiple imputation model To set up aregImpute here, we’ll need to specify: a suitable random seed with set.seed so we can replicate our work later a data set via the datadist stuff shown below the variables we want to include in the imputation process, which should include, at a minimum, any variables with missing values, and any variables we want to include in our outcome models n.impute = number of imputations, we’ll run 20 here10 nk = number of knots to describe level of complexity, with our choice nk = c(0, 3) we’ll fit both linear models and models with restricted cubic splines with 3 knots (this approach will wind up throwing some warnings here because some of our variables with missing values have only a few options so fitting splines is tough.) tlinear = FALSE allows the target variable for imputation to have a non-linear transformation when nk is 3 or more. Here, I’ll use tlinear = TRUE, the default. B = 10 specifies 10 bootstrap samples will be used pr = FALSE tells the machine not to print out which iteration is running as it goes. data specifies the source of the variables set.seed(432074) dd &lt;- datadist(smartcle_imp0) options(datadist = &quot;dd&quot;) imp_fit &lt;- aregImpute(~ exerany + physhealth + menthealth + genh_n + bmi + female + internet30 + sleephrs, nk = c(0, 3), tlinear = TRUE, data = smartcle_imp0, B = 10, n.impute = 20, pr = FALSE) OK. Here is the imputation model. The summary here isn’t especially critical. We want to see what was run, but to see what the results look like, we’ll need a plot, to come. imp_fit Multiple Imputation using Bootstrap and PMM aregImpute(formula = ~exerany + physhealth + menthealth + genh_n + bmi + female + internet30 + sleephrs, data = smartcle_imp0, n.impute = 20, nk = c(0, 3), tlinear = TRUE, pr = FALSE, B = 10) n: 1033 p: 8 Imputations: 20 nk: 0 Number of NAs: exerany physhealth menthealth genh_n bmi female 0 16 11 3 83 0 internet30 sleephrs 6 7 type d.f. exerany l 1 physhealth s 1 menthealth s 1 genh_n s 1 bmi s 1 female l 1 internet30 l 1 sleephrs s 1 Transformation of Target Variables Forced to be Linear R-squares for Predicting Non-Missing Values for Each Variable Using Last Imputations of Predictors physhealth menthealth genh_n bmi internet30 sleephrs 0.336 0.107 0.304 0.127 0.111 0.056 Resampling results for determining the complexity of imputation models Variable being imputed: physhealth nk=0 nk=3 Bootstrap bias-corrected R^2 0.289 0.399 10-fold cross-validated R^2 0.288 0.381 Bootstrap bias-corrected mean |error| 4.911 4.014 10-fold cross-validated mean |error| 4.253 4.091 Bootstrap bias-corrected median |error| 3.261 1.784 10-fold cross-validated median |error| 0.896 0.666 Variable being imputed: menthealth nk=0 nk=3 Bootstrap bias-corrected R^2 0.103 0.116 10-fold cross-validated R^2 0.110 0.128 Bootstrap bias-corrected mean |error| 3.660 3.651 10-fold cross-validated mean |error| 3.018 3.075 Bootstrap bias-corrected median |error| 1.957 1.780 10-fold cross-validated median |error| 0.715 0.786 Variable being imputed: genh_n nk=0 nk=3 Bootstrap bias-corrected R^2 0.323 0.319 10-fold cross-validated R^2 0.324 0.323 Bootstrap bias-corrected mean |error| 0.690 0.691 10-fold cross-validated mean |error| 2.537 2.538 Bootstrap bias-corrected median |error| 0.644 0.648 10-fold cross-validated median |error| 2.555 2.571 Variable being imputed: bmi nk=0 nk=3 Bootstrap bias-corrected R^2 0.0715 0.0919 10-fold cross-validated R^2 0.0825 0.0892 Bootstrap bias-corrected mean |error| 4.5861 4.5264 10-fold cross-validated mean |error| 27.8377 27.8712 Bootstrap bias-corrected median |error| 3.5091 3.5217 10-fold cross-validated median |error| 26.8401 26.7857 Variable being imputed: internet30 nk=0 nk=3 Bootstrap bias-corrected R^2 0.0843 0.0760 10-fold cross-validated R^2 0.1016 0.0825 Bootstrap bias-corrected mean |error| 0.2798 0.2857 10-fold cross-validated mean |error| 0.9636 0.9594 Bootstrap bias-corrected median |error| 0.1883 0.1819 10-fold cross-validated median |error| 0.7757 0.7467 Variable being imputed: sleephrs nk=0 nk=3 Bootstrap bias-corrected R^2 0.0075 -0.0072 10-fold cross-validated R^2 0.0330 0.0149 Bootstrap bias-corrected mean |error| 1.0102 1.0506 10-fold cross-validated mean |error| 7.0313 7.0163 Bootstrap bias-corrected median |error| 0.9287 0.9000 10-fold cross-validated median |error| 7.0066 6.9739 OK, let’s plot these imputed values. Note that we had six predictors with missing values in our data set, and so if we plot each of those, we’ll wind up with six plots. I’ll arrange them in a grid with three rows and two columns. par(mfrow = c(3,2)) plot(imp_fit) par(mfrow = c(1,1)) From these cumulative distribution functions, we can see that, for example, we imputed bmi values mostly between 20 and 35, with a few values below 20 or above 40. most of our imputed sleephrs were between 5 and 10 we imputed 1 for internet30 for about 70% of the subjects, and 0 for the other 30%. This predictive mean matching method never imputes a value for a variable that does not already exist in the data. 14.11 Combining the Imputation and Outcome Models So, now we have an imputation model, called imp_fit. and two outcome models: m1 and m2. What do we do with them? 14.11.1 Model 1 with Multiple Imputation To build the m1_imp multiple imputation fit for model m1, we use the fit.mult.impute command, and specify the model, the fitter (here, lrm), the imputation model (xtrans = imp_fit) and the data set prior to imputation (smartcle_imp0). m1_imp &lt;- fit.mult.impute(exerany ~ internet30 * catg(genh_n) + bmi * female + physhealth + menthealth + sleephrs, fitter = lrm, xtrans = imp_fit, data = smartcle_imp0, x = TRUE, y = TRUE) Variance Inflation Factors Due to Imputation: Intercept internet30 genh_n=2 1.03 1.00 1.01 genh_n=3 genh_n=4 genh_n=5 1.00 1.01 1.02 bmi female physhealth 1.06 1.08 1.05 menthealth sleephrs internet30 * genh_n=2 1.01 1.02 1.01 internet30 * genh_n=3 internet30 * genh_n=4 internet30 * genh_n=5 1.00 1.01 1.03 bmi * female 1.08 Rate of Missing Information: Intercept internet30 genh_n=2 0.03 0.00 0.01 genh_n=3 genh_n=4 genh_n=5 0.00 0.01 0.02 bmi female physhealth 0.05 0.07 0.04 menthealth sleephrs internet30 * genh_n=2 0.01 0.02 0.01 internet30 * genh_n=3 internet30 * genh_n=4 internet30 * genh_n=5 0.00 0.01 0.03 bmi * female 0.08 d.f. for t-distribution for Tests of Single Coefficients: Intercept internet30 genh_n=2 21695.29 4552554.82 342982.63 genh_n=3 genh_n=4 genh_n=5 2393040.31 340219.46 43771.65 bmi female physhealth 6985.80 3594.27 9984.27 menthealth sleephrs internet30 * genh_n=2 87510.83 39656.28 292980.96 internet30 * genh_n=3 internet30 * genh_n=4 internet30 * genh_n=5 6057039.66 610087.87 23370.34 bmi * female 3152.92 The following fit components were averaged over the 20 model fits: stats linear.predictors OK.

As we’ve discussed in previous work, the variables in the smartcle1.csv file are listed below, along with (in some cases) the BRFSS items that generate these responses. Variable Description SEQNO respondent identification number (all begin with 2016) physhealth Now thinking about your physical health, which includes physical illness and injury, for how many days during the past 30 days was your physical health not good? menthealth Now thinking about your mental health, which includes stress, depression, and problems with emotions, for how many days during the past 30 days was your mental health not good? poorhealth During the past 30 days, for about how many days did poor physical or mental health keep you from doing your usual activities, such as self-care, work, or recreation? genhealth Would you say that in general, your health is … (five categories: Excellent, Very Good, Good, Fair or Poor) bmi Body mass index, in kg/m2 female Sex, 1 = female, 0 = male internet30 Have you used the internet in the past 30 days? (1 = yes, 0 = no) exerany During the past month, other than your regular job, did you participate in any physical activities or exercises such as running, calisthenics, golf, gardening, or walking for exercise? (1 = yes, 0 = no) sleephrs On average, how many hours of sleep do you get in a 24-hour period? alcdays How many days during the past 30 days did you have at least one drink of any alcoholic beverage such as beer, wine, a malt beverage or liquor? In this section, we’ll use some of the variables described above to predict the quantitative outcome: sleephrs. 15.2 Thinking About Non-Linear Terms We have enough observations here to consider some non-linearity for our model. In addition, since the genhealth variable is an ordinal variable and multi-categorical, we should consider how to model it. We have three options: include it as a factor in the model (the default approach) build a numeric version of that variable, and then restrict our model to treat that numeric variable as ordinal (forcing the categories to affect the exerany probabilities in an ordinal way), rather than as a simple nominal factor (so that if the effect of fair vs. good was to decrease the probability of ‘exerany’, then the effect of poor vs. good would have to decrease the probability at least as much as fair vs. good did.) Treating the genhealth variable as ordinal could be accomplished with the scored function in the rms package. build a numeric version of genhealth and then use the catg function to specify the predictor as nominal and categorical, but this will lead to essentially the same model as choice 1. Suppose we’ve decided to treat the genhealth data as categorical, without restricting the effect of its various levels to be ordinal. Suppose also that we’ve decided to include the following eight variables in our model for sleephrs: genhealth menthealth bmi female internet30 exerany alcdays Suppose we have a subject matter understanding that: the impact of bmi on sleephrs is affected by female, so we plan a female x bmi interaction term we’re using internet30 as a proxy for poverty, and we think that an interaction with menthealth will be helpful in our model as well. Note that we do have some missing values in some of these predictors and in our outcome, so we’ll have to deal with that soon. smartcle1 %&gt;% select(sleephrs, alcdays, bmi, exerany, female, genhealth, internet30, menthealth) %&gt;% skim() Skim summary statistics n obs: 1036 n variables: 8 Variable type: factor variable missing complete n n_unique genhealth 3 1033 1036 5 top_counts ordered 2_V: 350, 3_G: 344, 1_E: 173, 4_F: 122 FALSE Variable type: integer variable missing complete n mean sd p0 p25 median p75 p100 alcdays 46 990 1036 4.65 8.05 0 0 1 4 30 exerany 3 1033 1036 0.76 0.43 0 1 1 1 1 female 0 1036 1036 0.6 0.49 0 0 1 1 1 internet30 6 1030 1036 0.81 0.39 0 1 1 1 1 menthealth 11 1025 1036 2.72 6.82 0 0 0 2 30 sleephrs 8 1028 1036 7.02 1.53 1 6 7 8 20 Variable type: numeric variable missing complete n mean sd p0 p25 median p75 p100 bmi 84 952 1036 27.89 6.47 12.71 23.7 26.68 30.53 66.06 15.3 A First Model for sleephrs (Complete Case Analysis) Suppose we develop a main-effects kitchen sink model (model mod.A below) fitted to these predictors without the benefit of any non-linear terms except the two pre-planned interactions. We’ll run the model quickly here to ensure that the code runs, in a complete case analysis, without drawing any conclusions, really. mod.A &lt;- ols(sleephrs ~ alcdays + bmi*female + exerany + genhealth + internet30*menthealth, data = smartcle1) mod.A Frequencies of Missing Values Due to Each Variable sleephrs alcdays bmi female exerany genhealth 8 46 84 0 3 3 internet30 menthealth 6 11 Linear Regression Model ols(formula = sleephrs ~ alcdays + bmi * female + exerany + genhealth + internet30 * menthealth, data = smartcle1) Model Likelihood Discrimination Ratio Test Indexes Obs 903 LR chi2 16.80 R2 0.018 sigma1.4784 d.f. 12 R2 adj 0.005 d.f. 890 Pr(&gt; chi2) 0.1571 g 0.209 Residuals Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -6.10511 -0.96284 -0.02392 0.89816 13.66445 Coef S.E. t Pr(&gt;|t|) Intercept 6.8562 0.4336 15.81 &lt;0.0001 alcdays -0.0077 0.0063 -1.22 0.2240 bmi 0.0075 0.0135 0.56 0.5784 female 0.6701 0.4729 1.42 0.1569 exerany -0.0185 0.1250 -0.15 0.8822 genhealth=2_VeryGood 0.1267 0.1474 0.86 0.3903 genhealth=3_Good 0.0930 0.1530 0.61 0.5433 genhealth=4_Fair -0.1099 0.2019 -0.54 0.5864 genhealth=5_Poor -0.1118 0.2828 -0.40 0.6927 internet30 -0.0768 0.1434 -0.54 0.5926 menthealth -0.0171 0.0161 -1.06 0.2902 bmi * female -0.0207 0.0165 -1.26 0.2092 internet30 * menthealth -0.0027 0.0179 -0.15 0.8793 plot(anova(mod.A)) 15.4 Building a Larger Model: Spearman \\(\\rho^2\\) Plot Before we impute, we might also consider the use of a Spearman \\(\\rho^2\\) plot to decide how best to spend degrees of freedom on non-linear terms in our model for sleephrs using these predictors. Since we’re already planning some interaction terms, I’ll keep them in mind as I look at this plot. sp_smart2 &lt;- spearman2(sleephrs ~ genhealth + exerany + female + internet30 + menthealth + bmi + alcdays, data = smartcle1) plot(sp_smart2) We see that the best candidate for a non-linear term is the menthealth variable, according to this plot, followed by the genhealth and bmi predictors. I will wind up fitting a model including the following non-linear terms… our pre-planned female x bmi and internet30 x menthealth interaction terms, a restricted cubic spline with 5 knots for menthealth an interaction between genhealth and the linear part of menthealth a restricted cubic spline with 4 knots for bmi (so the interaction term with female will need to account for this and restrict our interaction to the linear piece of bmi) 15.5 A Second Model for sleephrs (Complete Cases) Here’s the resulting model fit without worrying about imputation yet. This is just to make sure our code works. Note that I’m inserting the main effects of our interaction terms explicitly before including the interaction terms themselves, and that I need to use %ia% to include the interaction terms where one of the terms is included in the model with a spline. Again, I won’t draw any serious conclusions yet. mod.B &lt;- ols(sleephrs ~ rcs(menthealth, 5) + genhealth + genhealth %ia% menthealth + rcs(bmi, 4) + female + female %ia% bmi + internet30 + internet30 %ia% menthealth + alcdays + exerany, data = smartcle1) mod.B Frequencies of Missing Values Due to Each Variable sleephrs menthealth genhealth bmi female internet30 8 11 3 84 0 6 alcdays exerany 46 3 Linear Regression Model ols(formula = sleephrs ~ rcs(menthealth, 5) + genhealth + genhealth %ia% menthealth + rcs(bmi, 4) + female + female %ia% bmi + internet30 + internet30 %ia% menthealth + alcdays + exerany, data = smartcle1) Model Likelihood Discrimination Ratio Test Indexes Obs 903 LR chi2 27.03 R2 0.029 sigma1.4759 d.f. 19 R2 adj 0.009 d.f. 883 Pr(&gt; chi2) 0.1040 g 0.258 Residuals Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -6.11835 -0.93539 -0.02598 0.87085 13.68653 Coef S.E. t Pr(&gt;|t|) Intercept 5.9217 1.0518 5.63 &lt;0.0001 menthealth -0.0759 0.0424 -1.79 0.0736 menthealth&#39; 0.5218 0.3285 1.59 0.1126 genhealth=2_VeryGood 0.1716 0.1554 1.10 0.2699 genhealth=3_Good 0.0630 0.1624 0.39 0.6982 genhealth=4_Fair -0.0269 0.2216 -0.12 0.9035 genhealth=5_Poor -0.1593 0.3468 -0.46 0.6461 genhealth=2_VeryGood * menthealth -0.0382 0.0287 -1.33 0.1836 genhealth=3_Good * menthealth 0.0157 0.0227 0.69 0.4893 genhealth=4_Fair * menthealth -0.0112 0.0239 -0.47 0.6415 genhealth=5_Poor * menthealth 0.0109 0.0286 0.38 0.7044 bmi 0.0469 0.0449 1.05 0.2962 bmi&#39; -0.1237 0.2050 -0.60 0.5463 bmi&#39;&#39; 0.2755 0.5607 0.49 0.6233 female 0.7588 0.4796 1.58 0.1140 female * bmi -0.0228 0.0166 -1.37 0.1707 internet30 -0.0765 0.1443 -0.53 0.5962 internet30 * menthealth 0.0023 0.0184 0.12 0.9006 alcdays -0.0069 0.0063 -1.10 0.2726 exerany 0.0080 0.1254 0.06 0.9488 plot(anova(mod.B)) It looks like menthealth may be the only significant term. 15.6 Dealing with Missing Data via Simple Imputation One approach we might take in this problem is to use simple imputation to deal with our missing values. I will proceed as follows: Omit all cases where the outcome sleephrs is missing. Determine (and plot) the remaining missingness. Use simple imputation for all predictors, and build a new data set with “complete” data. Re-fit the proposed models using this new data set. 15.6.1 Omit cases where the outcome is missing We need to drop the cases where sleephrs is missing in smartcle1. We’ll begin creating an imputed data set, called smartcle2_imp0, by filtering on complete data for sleephrs, as follows. Note that the describe function in Hmisc specifies the number of non-missing observations in n.

Of course, we can get a count of missing values within each variable with skim or with: colSums(is.na(smartcle2_imp0)) SEQNO sleephrs alcdays bmi exerany female 0 0 45 82 2 0 genhealth internet30 menthealth 2 6 11 The Hmisc package has a plotting approach which can help identify missingness, too. naplot(naclus(select(smartcle2_imp0, -SEQNO))) We can also get a useful accounting of missing data patterns, with the md.pattern function in the mice package. mice::md.pattern(smartcle2_imp0) SEQNO sleephrs female exerany genhealth internet30 menthealth alcdays 903 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 29 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 67 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 9 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 10 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 5 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 6 11 45 bmi 903 1 0 29 1 1 67 0 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 9 1 1 10 0 2 1 1 2 5 0 3 1 1 3 82 148 We can also do this with na.pattern in the Hmisc package, but then we have to get the names of the columns, too, so that we can read off the values. na.pattern(smartcle2_imp0) pattern 000000000 000000001 000000010 000000101 000010000 000100000 001000000 903 9 1 1 2 67 29 001000101 001100000 001100010 1 10 5 names(smartcle2_imp0) [1] &quot;SEQNO&quot; &quot;sleephrs&quot; &quot;alcdays&quot; &quot;bmi&quot; &quot;exerany&quot; [6] &quot;female&quot; &quot;genhealth&quot; &quot;internet30&quot; &quot;menthealth&quot; 15.6.3 Use simple imputation, build a new data set The only variables that require no imputation are sleephrs and female. In this case, we need to impute: 82 bmi values (which are quantitative) 45 alcdays values (quantitative, must fall between 0 and 30) 11 menthealth values (quantitative, must fall between 0 and 30) 6 internet30 values (which are 1/0) 2 exerany values (which are also 1/0) and 2 genhealth values (which are multi-categorical, so we need to convert them to numbers in order to get the imputation process to work properly) smartcle2_imp0 &lt;- smartcle2_imp0 %&gt;% mutate(genh_n = as.numeric(genhealth)) smartcle2_imp0 %&gt;% count(genhealth, genh_n) # A tibble: 6 x 3 genhealth genh_n n &lt;fct&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; 1 1_Excellent 1. 172 2 2_VeryGood 2. 349 3 3_Good 3. 341 4 4_Fair 4. 120 5 5_Poor 5. 44 6 &lt;NA&gt; NA 2 I’ll work from the bottom up, using various simputation functions to accomplish the imputations I want. In this case, I’ll use predictive mean matching for the categorical data, and linear models or elastic net approaches for the quantitative data.

Looks good. I now have a data frame called smartcle2_imp1 with no missingness, which I can use to fit my logistic regression models. Let’s do that next, and then return to the problem of accounting for missingness through multiple imputation. 15.7 Refitting Model A with simply imputed data Using the numeric version of the genhealth data, called genh_n, will ease the reviewing of later output, so we’ll do that here, making sure R knows that genh_n describes a categorical factor. d &lt;- datadist(smartcle2_imp1) options(datadist = &quot;d&quot;) mod.A2 &lt;- ols(sleephrs ~ alcdays + bmi*female + exerany + genhealth + internet30*menthealth, data = smartcle2_imp1, x = TRUE, y = TRUE) mod.A2 Linear Regression Model ols(formula = sleephrs ~ alcdays + bmi * female + exerany + genhealth + internet30 * menthealth, data = smartcle2_imp1, x = TRUE, y = TRUE) Model Likelihood Discrimination Ratio Test Indexes Obs 1028 LR chi2 24.61 R2 0.024 sigma1.5193 d.f. 12 R2 adj 0.012 d.f. 1015 Pr(&gt; chi2) 0.0168 g 0.245 Residuals Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -6.15720 -0.95552 -0.03011 0.86804 13.80609 Coef S.E. t Pr(&gt;|t|) Intercept 6.9916 0.4305 16.24 &lt;0.0001 alcdays -0.0101 0.0062 -1.62 0.1048 bmi 0.0080 0.0135 0.59 0.5558 female 0.7360 0.4682 1.57 0.1162 exerany -0.0898 0.1201 -0.75 0.4550 genhealth=2_VeryGood 0.1248 0.1430 0.87 0.3832 genhealth=3_Good 0.0912 0.1483 0.62 0.5386 genhealth=4_Fair -0.2083 0.1945 -1.07 0.2844 genhealth=5_Poor 0.1361 0.2722 0.50 0.6173 internet30 -0.1282 0.1374 -0.93 0.3510 menthealth -0.0228 0.0164 -1.39 0.1635 bmi * female -0.0248 0.0163 -1.52 0.1284 internet30 * menthealth 0.0004 0.0180 0.02 0.9811 All right.

This output suggests that in a new sample of data, our model shouldn’t be expected to do anything useful at all. 15.7.2 ANOVA for the model Next, let’s look at the ANOVA comparisons for this (admittedly terrible) prediction model. anova(mod.A2) Analysis of Variance Response: sleephrs Factor d.f.

We can also build a plot of the AIC values attributable to each piece of the model. plot(anova(mod.A2), what=&quot;aic&quot;) We can also plot the Partial R2 values for each predictor. The partial R2 for internet30, for instance, is the R2 value that you would obtain if you first regress internet30 on every other predictor in the model, take the residuals, and then regress those on internet30. It simply tells you, then, how much of the tiny amount of variation explained by the model as a whole is accounted for by each predictor after all of the other ones have already been accounted for. The partial R2 values, therefore, do not sum up to the total R2 explained by the model. In our case, the menthealth variable is again far and away the most “useful” variable. plot(anova(mod.A2), what=&quot;partial&quot;) 15.7.3 Summarizing Effect Size How big are the effects we see? plot(summary(mod.A2)) summary(mod.A2) Effects Response : sleephrs Factor Low High Diff.

Interpret the results as differences in our outcome sleephrs associated with the expressed changes in predictors, holding the others constant. holding all other predictors constant, the effect of moving from alcdays = 0 to alcdays = 5 is -0.05 hours of sleep. We also have a 95% confidence interval for this estimate, which is (-0.11, 0.01). Since 0 is in that interval, we cannot conclude that the effect of alcdays on sleephrs is either definitely positive or definitely negative. A similar approach can be used to describe the effects on sleephrs associated with each predictor. Note that each of the categories in genh_n is compared to a single baseline category. Here, that’s category 2. R will pick the modal category: the one that appears most often in the data. The comparisons of each category against category 2 are not significant in each case, at the 5% level. 15.7.4 Plotting the Model with ggplot and Predict Let’s look at a series of plots describing the model for sleephrs. ggplot(Predict(mod.A2)) This helps us describe what is happening in terms of direction at least. For example, As menthealth increases, predicted sleephrs actually decreases. In general, though, the impact of these predictors on sleephrs appears minimal. 15.7.5 Plotting the model with a nomogram plot(nomogram(mod.A2)) Note the impact of our interaction terms, and how we have two lines for bmi and two lines for menthealth that ` that come out of our product terms. As with any nomogram, to make a prediction we: find the values of each of our predictors in the scales, and travel vertically up to the Points line to read off the Points for that predictor. sum up the Points across all predictors, and find that location in the Total Points line. move vertically down from the total points line to find the estimated “linear predictor” (sleephrs) 15.7.6 Residual Plots for mod.A2 We can obtain our usual residual plots for a linear model. Or, we can obtain things like the residuals and fitted values directly, to produce a plot. For example, plot(mod.A2$residuals ~ mod.A2$fitted.values) Or we can get the same residuals vs. fitted values plot with: plot(mod.A2, &quot;ordinary&quot;, which = 1) 15.8 Refitting Model B with simply imputed data I’ll walk through the same tasks for Model m2 that I did above for Model m1. Again, we’re running this model after simple imputation of missing values. Using the numeric version of the genhealth data, called genh_n, will ease the reviewing of later output, so we’ll do that here, making sure R knows that genh_n describes a categorical factor. d &lt;- datadist(smartcle2_imp1) options(datadist = &quot;d&quot;) mod.B2 &lt;- ols(sleephrs ~ rcs(menthealth, 5) + genhealth + genhealth %ia% menthealth + internet30 + internet30 %ia% menthealth + rcs(bmi, 4) + female + female %ia% bmi + alcdays + exerany, data = smartcle2_imp1, x = TRUE, y = TRUE) mod.B2 Linear Regression Model ols(formula = sleephrs ~ rcs(menthealth, 5) + genhealth + genhealth %ia% menthealth + internet30 + internet30 %ia% menthealth + rcs(bmi, 4) + female + female %ia% bmi + alcdays + exerany, data = smartcle2_imp1, x = TRUE, y = TRUE) Model Likelihood Discrimination Ratio Test Indexes Obs 1028 LR chi2 31.84 R2 0.031 sigma1.5192 d.f. 19 R2 adj 0.012 d.f. 1008 Pr(&gt; chi2) 0.0325 g 0.274 Residuals Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -6.12337 -0.95462 -0.03322 0.86403 13.69249 Coef S.E. t Pr(&gt;|t|) Intercept 6.5183 1.0161 6.41 &lt;0.0001 menthealth -0.0605 0.0412 -1.47 0.1417 menthealth&#39; 0.3943 0.3175 1.24 0.2146 genhealth=2_VeryGood 0.1637 0.1513 1.08 0.2793 genhealth=3_Good 0.0691 0.1580 0.44 0.6618 genhealth=4_Fair -0.1475 0.2140 -0.69 0.4908 genhealth=5_Poor 0.2443 0.3336 0.73 0.4641 genhealth=2_VeryGood * menthealth -0.0333 0.0270 -1.23 0.2177 genhealth=3_Good * menthealth 0.0065 0.0217 0.30 0.7636 genhealth=4_Fair * menthealth -0.0113 0.0233 -0.48 0.6292 genhealth=5_Poor * menthealth -0.0137 0.0275 -0.50 0.6190 internet30 -0.1221 0.1386 -0.88 0.3788 internet30 * menthealth 0.0034 0.0185 0.18 0.8544 bmi 0.0253 0.0430 0.59 0.5563 bmi&#39; 0.0129 0.1925 0.07 0.9467 bmi&#39;&#39; -0.1314 0.5808 -0.23 0.8210 female 0.7775 0.4746 1.64 0.1017 female * bmi -0.0255 0.0165 -1.54 0.1228 alcdays -0.0094 0.0063 -1.50 0.1334 exerany -0.0713 0.1206 -0.59 0.5545 The model still uses 1028 observations, and shows an R2 value of 0.031, marginally better than what we saw in mod.A2.

The results are, again, interpreted as differences in predicted sleephrs. For example, holding all other predictors constant, the effect of moving from menthealth = 0 to menthealth = 2 is a decline of 0.18 in predicted sleephrs, with 95% CI (-0.33, -0.03) hours. 15.8.4 Plotting the Model with ggplot and Predict Again, consider a series of plots describing the model mod.B2. ggplot(Predict(mod.B2)) Note the small kink in the bmi plot. To what do you attribute this? 15.9 Comparing Model B.2 to Model A.2 after simple imputation We can refit the models with glm and then compare them with anova, aic and bic approaches, if we like. mA2_lm &lt;- lm(sleephrs ~ alcdays + bmi*female + exerany + genhealth + internet30*menthealth, data = smartcle2_imp1) mB2_lm &lt;- lm(sleephrs ~ rcs(menthealth, 5) + genhealth + genhealth %ia% menthealth + internet30 + internet30 %ia% menthealth + rcs(bmi, 4) + female + female %ia% bmi + alcdays + exerany, data = smartcle2_imp1) 15.9.1 Comparison by Analysis of Variance anova(mA2_lm, mB2_lm) Analysis of Variance Table Model 1: sleephrs ~ alcdays + bmi * female + exerany + genhealth + internet30 * menthealth Model 2: sleephrs ~ rcs(menthealth, 5) + genhealth + genhealth %ia% menthealth + internet30 + internet30 %ia% menthealth + rcs(bmi, 4) + female + female %ia% bmi + alcdays + exerany Res.Df RSS Df Sum of Sq F Pr(&gt;F) 1 1015 2342.9 2 1008 2326.5 7 16.435 1.0172 0.4172 The additional terms in model B2 don’t seem to improve the fit significantly. 15.9.2 Comparing AIC and BIC glance(mA2_lm) r.squared adj.r.squared sigma statistic p.value df logLik 1 0.02365341 0.0121104 1.519309 2.049154 0.01784591 13 -1882.094 AIC BIC deviance df.residual 1 3792.188 3861.283 2342.924 1015 glance(mB2_lm) r.squared adj.r.squared sigma statistic p.value df logLik 1 0.0305021 0.01222783 1.519219 1.669129 0.03567068 20 -1878.476 AIC BIC deviance df.residual 1 3798.952 3902.595 2326.489 1008 Model mA2_lm shows lower AIC and BIC than does mB2_lm, but as we see in the R2 values, they are both terrible models. 15.10 Dealing with Missing Data via Multiple Imputation Next, we’ll use the aregImpute function within the Hmisc package to predict all missing values for all of our variables, using additive regression bootstrapping and predictive mean matching. The steps for this work are as follows: aregImpute draws a sample with replacement from the observations where the target variable is observed, not missing. aregImpute then fits a flexible additive model to predict this target variable while finding the optimum transformation of it. aregImpute then uses this fitted flexible model to predict the target variable in all of the original observations. Finally, aregImpute imputes each missing value of the target variable with the observed value whose predicted transformed value is closest to the predicted transformed value of the missing value. We’ll start with the smartcle2_imp0 data set, which contains only the subjects in the original smartcle1 data where sleephrs is available, and which includes only the variables of interest to us, including both the factor (genhealth) and numeric (genh_n) versions of the genhealth data. summary(smartcle2_imp0) SEQNO sleephrs alcdays bmi Min. :2.016e+09 Min. : 1.000 Min. : 0.000 Min. :12.71 1st Qu.:2.016e+09 1st Qu.: 6.000 1st Qu.: 0.000 1st Qu.:23.70 Median :2.016e+09 Median : 7.000 Median : 1.000 Median :26.68 Mean :2.016e+09 Mean : 7.018 Mean : 4.672 Mean :27.86 3rd Qu.:2.016e+09 3rd Qu.: 8.000 3rd Qu.: 4.000 3rd Qu.:30.53 Max. :2.016e+09 Max. :20.000 Max. :30.000 Max. :66.06 NA&#39;s :45 NA&#39;s :82 exerany female genhealth internet30 Min. :0.0000 Min. :0.0000 1_Excellent:172 Min. :0.0000 1st Qu.:1.0000 1st Qu.:0.0000 2_VeryGood :349 1st Qu.:1.0000 Median :1.0000 Median :1.0000 3_Good :341 Median :1.0000 Mean :0.7622 Mean :0.6012 4_Fair :120 Mean :0.8112 3rd Qu.:1.0000 3rd Qu.:1.0000 5_Poor : 44 3rd Qu.:1.0000 Max. :1.0000 Max. :1.0000 NA&#39;s : 2 Max. :1.0000 NA&#39;s :2 NA&#39;s :6 menthealth genh_n Min. : 0.000 Min. :1.000 1st Qu.: 0.000 1st Qu.:2.000 Median : 0.000 Median :2.000 Mean : 2.707 Mean :2.527 3rd Qu.: 2.000 3rd Qu.:3.000 Max. :30.000 Max. :5.000 NA&#39;s :11 NA&#39;s :2 The smartcle2_imp0 data set contains 1028 rows (subjects) and 10 columns (variables.) 15.10.1 Using aregImpute to fit a multiple imputation model To set up aregImpute here, we’ll need to specify: a suitable random seed with set.seed so we can replicate our work later a data set via the datadist stuff shown below the variables we want to include in the imputation process, which should include, at a minimum, any variables with missing values, and any variables we want to include in our outcome models n.impute = number of imputations, we’ll run 20 here11 nk = number of knots to describe level of complexity, with our choice nk = c(0, 3) we’ll fit both linear models and models with restricted cubic splines with 3 knots (this approach will wind up throwing some warnings here because some of our variables with missing values have only a few options so fitting splines is tough.) tlinear = FALSE allows the target variable for imputation to have a non-linear transformation when nk is 3 or more. Here, I’ll use tlinear = TRUE, the default. B = 10 specifies 10 bootstrap samples will be used pr = FALSE tells the machine not to print out which iteration is running as it goes. data specifies the source of the variables set.seed(432365) dd &lt;- datadist(smartcle2_imp0) options(datadist = &quot;dd&quot;) imp_fit &lt;- aregImpute(~ sleephrs + alcdays + bmi + exerany + female + genh_n + internet30 + menthealth, nk = c(0, 3), tlinear = TRUE, data = smartcle2_imp0, B = 10, n.impute = 20, pr = FALSE) OK. Here is the imputation model. The summary here isn’t especially critical. We want to see what was run, but to see what the results look like, we’ll need a plot, to come. imp_fit Multiple Imputation using Bootstrap and PMM aregImpute(formula = ~sleephrs + alcdays + bmi + exerany + female + genh_n + internet30 + menthealth, data = smartcle2_imp0, n.impute = 20, nk = c(0, 3), tlinear = TRUE, pr = FALSE, B = 10) n: 1028 p: 8 Imputations: 20 nk: 0 Number of NAs: sleephrs alcdays bmi exerany female genh_n 0 45 82 2 0 2 internet30 menthealth 6 11 type d.f. sleephrs s 1 alcdays s 1 bmi s 1 exerany l 1 female l 1 genh_n s 1 internet30 l 1 menthealth s 1 Transformation of Target Variables Forced to be Linear R-squares for Predicting Non-Missing Values for Each Variable Using Last Imputations of Predictors alcdays bmi exerany genh_n internet30 menthealth 0.071 0.094 0.166 0.212 0.151 0.083 Resampling results for determining the complexity of imputation models Variable being imputed: alcdays nk=0 nk=3 Bootstrap bias-corrected R^2 0.0687 0.0612 10-fold cross-validated R^2 0.0706 0.0678 Bootstrap bias-corrected mean |error| 5.3804 5.2618 10-fold cross-validated mean |error| 4.9122 4.9570 Bootstrap bias-corrected median |error| 3.7094 3.7051 10-fold cross-validated median |error| 1.6790 1.7335 Variable being imputed: bmi nk=0 nk=3 Bootstrap bias-corrected R^2 0.0904 0.100 10-fold cross-validated R^2 0.1061 0.103 Bootstrap bias-corrected mean |error| 4.3705 4.400 10-fold cross-validated mean |error| 27.8053 27.767 Bootstrap bias-corrected median |error| 3.2927 3.409 10-fold cross-validated median |error| 26.8306 26.687 Variable being imputed: exerany nk=0 nk=3 Bootstrap bias-corrected R^2 0.135 0.116 10-fold cross-validated R^2 0.135 0.125 Bootstrap bias-corrected mean |error| 0.317 0.317 10-fold cross-validated mean |error| 0.930 0.899 Bootstrap bias-corrected median |error| 0.248 0.231 10-fold cross-validated median |error| 0.740 0.671 Variable being imputed: genh_n nk=0 nk=3 Bootstrap bias-corrected R^2 0.198 0.236 10-fold cross-validated R^2 0.200 0.225 Bootstrap bias-corrected mean |error| 0.744 0.731 10-fold cross-validated mean |error| 2.538 2.531 Bootstrap bias-corrected median |error| 0.646 0.650 10-fold cross-validated median |error| 2.532 2.524 Variable being imputed: internet30 nk=0 nk=3 Bootstrap bias-corrected R^2 0.101 0.125 10-fold cross-validated R^2 0.109 0.121 Bootstrap bias-corrected mean |error| 0.279 0.272 10-fold cross-validated mean |error| 0.992 0.983 Bootstrap bias-corrected median |error| 0.190 0.190 10-fold cross-validated median |error| 0.817 0.819 Variable being imputed: menthealth nk=0 nk=3 Bootstrap bias-corrected R^2 0.0573 0.102 10-fold cross-validated R^2 0.0969 0.116 Bootstrap bias-corrected mean |error| 3.8132 3.712 10-fold cross-validated mean |error| 3.1552 3.112 Bootstrap bias-corrected median |error| 2.3749 1.979 10-fold cross-validated median |error| 0.9384 0.783 OK, let’s plot these imputed values. Note that we had six predictors with missing values in our data set, and so if we plot each of those, we’ll wind up with six plots. I’ll arrange them in a grid with three rows and two columns. par(mfrow = c(3,2)) plot(imp_fit) par(mfrow = c(1,1)) From these cumulative distribution functions, we can see that, for example, we imputed bmi values mostly between 20 and 35, with a few values below 20 or above 40. most of our imputed alcdays were between 0 and 5 we imputed 1 for internet30 for about 70% of the subjects, and 0 for the other 30%. This predictive mean matching method never imputes a value for a variable that does not already exist in the data. 15.11 Combining the Imputation and Outcome Models So, now we have an imputation model, called imp_fit. and two outcome models: mod.A and mod.B. What do we do with them? 15.11.1 Model A with Multiple Imputation To build the mA_imp multiple imputation fit for model mod.A, we use the fit.mult.impute command, and specify the model, the fitter (here, lrm), the imputation model (xtrans = imp_fit) and the data set prior to imputation (smartcle2_imp0). mA_imp &lt;- fit.mult.impute(sleephrs ~ alcdays + bmi*female + exerany + catg(genh_n) + internet30*menthealth, fitter = ols, xtrans = imp_fit, data = smartcle2_imp0, x = TRUE, y = TRUE) Variance Inflation Factors Due to Imputation: Intercept alcdays bmi 1.22 1.02 1.29 female exerany genh_n=2 1.21 1.01 1.00 genh_n=3 genh_n=4 genh_n=5 1.01 1.01 1.00 internet30 menthealth bmi * female 1.01 1.01 1.22 internet30 * menthealth 1.01 Rate of Missing Information: Intercept alcdays bmi 0.18 0.02 0.22 female exerany genh_n=2 0.18 0.01 0.00 genh_n=3 genh_n=4 genh_n=5 0.01 0.01 0.00 internet30 menthealth bmi * female 0.01 0.01 0.18 internet30 * menthealth 0.01 d.f. for t-distribution for Tests of Single Coefficients: Intercept alcdays bmi 593.81 56125.67 384.31 female exerany genh_n=2 618.43 204840.97 2743445.99 genh_n=3 genh_n=4 genh_n=5 197711.45 230304.96 812145.77 internet30 menthealth bmi * female 573166.43 100933.56 582.27 internet30 * menthealth 149596.38 The following fit components were averaged over the 20 model fits: fitted.values stats linear.predictors OK.

We’ll skip it for now. The model remains terrible. 100 is generally safe but time-consuming. In the old days, we used to say 5. A reasonable idea is to identify the fraction of missingness in your variable with the most missingness, and if that’s 0.10, then you should run at least 100(0.10) = 10 sets of imputations.↩ "],

What do we do if our binary outcome is not available for each subject individually, but instead aggregated? What is probit regression, and how can we use it as an alternative to logistic regression on a binary outcome? 16.1 Logistic Regression for Aggregated Data 16.1.1 Colorectal Cancer Screening Data The screening.csv data (imported into the R tibble colscr are simulated. They mirror a subset of the actual results from the Better Health Partnership’s pilot study of colorectal cancer screening in primary care clinics in Northeast Ohio, but the numbers have been fuzzed slightly, and the clinics have been de-identified and moved around from system to system.

Let’s look more closely at the coefficients of the probit model we just fit. m_scr2_probit$coef (Intercept) age raceOther 1.584603569 0.013461338 -1.238445198 raceWhite hispanic insuranceMedicaid -0.199260184 0.029483051 -0.619276718 insuranceMedicare insuranceUninsured bmi -0.322880519 0.052775722 0.009652339 sbp -0.014695526 The probit regression coefficients give the change in the z-score of the outcome of interest (here, up_to_date) for a one-unit change in the target predictor, holding all other predictors constant. So, for a one-year increase in age, holding all other predictors constant, the z-score for up_to_date increases by 0.013 And for a Medicaid subject as compared to a Commercial subject of the same age, race, ethnicity, bmi and sbp, the z-score for the Medicaid subject is predicted to be -0.619 lower, according to this model. 16.2.6 What about Harry and Sally?

In this work, we will focus on data from the 2016 SMART, and in particular on data from the state of Ohio, and from the Cleveland-Elyria, OH, Metropolitan Statistical Area. The purpose of this survey is to provide localized health information that can help public health practitioners identify local emerging health problems, plan and evaluate local responses, and efficiently allocate resources to specific needs. In this chapter, I describe all of the cleaning I have done (so far) on the BRFSS SMART data, and break it out into national, statewide, and local samples. The data files produced by this chapter include: smart_ohio.csv which includes data on 57 variables for 6014 subjects in five MMSAs in Ohio. smartcle.csv which includes data on those same 57 variables for the 1036 subjects in the Cleveland-Elyria-Lorain OH MMSA. smartcle1.csv which includes a subset of 11 variables for those same 1036 subjects. SMART and BRFSS The Centers for Disease Control analyzes Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey data for specific metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas (MMSAs) in a program called the Selected Metropolitan/Micropolitan Area Risk Trends of BRFSS (SMART BRFSS.) In this work, we will focus on data from the 2016 SMART, and in particular on data from the Cleveland-Elyria, OH, Metropolitan Statistical Area. The purpose of this survey is to provide localized health information that can help public health practitioners identify local emerging health problems, plan and evaluate local responses, and efficiently allocate resources to specific needs. 17.1 Key resources the data, in the form of the 2016 SMART BRFSS MMSA Data, found in a zipped SAS Transport Format file. The data were released in August 2017. the MMSA Variable Layout PDF which simply lists the variables included in the data file the Calculated Variables PDF which describes the risk factors by data variable names - there is also an online summary matrix of these calculated variables, as well. the lengthy 2016 Survey Questions PDF which lists all questions asked as part of the BRFSS in 2016 the enormous Codebook for the 2016 BRFSS Survey PDF which identifies the variables by name for us. 17.2 Ingesting The Raw Data library(skimr) library(broom); library(modelr) library(haven); library(tidyverse) 17.3 The National Data To create the data files we’ll use, I used the read_xpt function from the haven package to bring in the SAS XPT data file that is provided by CDC. The codes I used (but won’t use in these Notes) were: smart.raw &lt;- read_xpt(&quot;data/MMSA2016.xpt&quot;) %&gt;% tbl_df dim(smart.raw) This gives the nationwide data, which has 249,011 rows and 146 columns. But for the purposes of putting these Notes online, I needed to crank down the sample size enormously. To that end, I created a new data file, called smartorig.csv, which I developed by importing the MMSA2016.xpt file filtering away all observations except those from the state of Ohio saving it So, for purposes of these notes, our complete data set is actually coming from smartorg.csv and consists only of the 6,014 observations from Ohio. smart.raw &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data/smartorig.csv&quot;) %&gt;% tbl_df Parsed with column specification: cols( .default = col_integer(), HIVTSTD3 = col_double(), `_BMI5` = col_double(), `_DRNKWEK` = col_double(), `_MMSAWT` = col_double(), SEQNO = col_double(), MMSANAME = col_character() ) See spec(...) for full column specifications.

A value of 88 indicates “none” and should be recoded to 0. 77 is the code for Don’t know/Not sure 99 is the code for Refused BLANK indicates Not asked or missing, and R recognizes this as NA properly. To clean up PHYSHLTH to a new variable called physhealth, we’ll need: - to convince R that the 77 and 99 values are in fact best interpreted as NA, and - to convince R that the 88 should be interpreted as 0. smart.raw &lt;- smart.raw %&gt;% mutate(physhealth = PHYSHLTH, physhealth = replace(physhealth, physhealth %in% c(77, 99), NA), physhealth = replace(physhealth, physhealth == 88, 0)) smart.raw %&gt;% count(PHYSHLTH, physhealth) %&gt;% tail() # A tibble: 6 x 3 PHYSHLTH physhealth n &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; 1 28 28. 5 2 29 29. 1 3 30 30. 482 4 77 NA 82 5 88 0. 3798 6 99 NA 12 Note that we present the tail of the counts in this case so we can see what happens to the key values (77, 88, 99) of our original variable PHYSHLTH. 17.4.2.2 MENTHLTH and its cleanup to menthealth MENTHLTH`, the Number of Days Mental Health Not Good variable, which is the response to “Now thinking about your mental health, which includes stress, depression, and problems with emotions, for how many days during the past 30 days was your mental health not good?” This is coded just like the PHYSHLTH variable, so we need to do the same cleaning we did there.

We’ll create a hasdoc variable which is simply Yes or No, and a factor variable called numdocs2 which keeps the first three levels in place.

The main conclusion seems to be that 0 is by far the most common response. Here’s a table by age group of: the number of respondents in that age group, the group’s mean physhealth response (remember that these are the number of poor physical health days in the last 30), their median physhealth response (which turns out to be 0 in each group), and the percentage of group members who responded 0. sm_oh_A %&gt;% group_by(agegroup) %&gt;% summarize(n = n(), mean = round(mean(physhealth),2), median = median(physhealth), percent_0s = round(100*sum(physhealth == 0)/n,1)) # A tibble: 13 x 5 agegroup n mean median percent_0s &lt;fct&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 18-24 243 1.91 0. 65.4 2 25-29 220 2.39 0. 66.4 3 30-34 282 3.11 0. 68.8 4 35-39 241 2.95 0. 70.1 5 40-44 285 2.91 0. 66.0 6 45-49 364 2.95 0. 69.8 7 50-54 403 5.11 0. 61.5 8 55-59 510 5.37 0. 57.3 9 60-64 515 4.33 0. 61.2 10 65-69 550 4.34 0. 64.2 11 70-74 349 5.38 0. 64.5 12 75-79 270 5.54 0. 60.7 13 80-96 320 5.68 0. 61.6 We can see a real change between the 45-49 age group and the 50-54 age group. The mean difference is clear from the table above, and the plot below (of the percentage with a zero response) in each age group identifies the same story. sm_oh_A %&gt;% group_by(agegroup) %&gt;% summarize(n = n(), percent_0s = round(100*sum(physhealth == 0)/n,1)) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(y = agegroup, x = percent_0s)) + geom_label(aes(label = percent_0s)) + labs(x = &quot;% with no Bad Physical Health Days in last 30&quot;, y = &quot;Age Group&quot;) It looks like we have a fairly consistent result in the younger age range (18-49) or the older range (50+). On the theory that most of the people reading this document are in that younger range, we’ll focus on those respondents in what follows. 18.3 Exploratory Data Analysis (in the 18-49 group) We want to predict the 0-30 physhealth count variable for the 18-49 year old respondents. To start, we’ll use two predictors: the respondent’s body mass index, and whether the respondent has smoked 100 cigarettes in their lifetime. We anticipate that each of these variables will have positive associations with the physhealth score. That is, heavier people, and those who have used tobacco will be less healthy, and thus have higher numbers of poor physical health days. 18.3.1 Build a subset of those ages 18-49 First, we’ll identify the subset of respondents who are between 18 and 49 years of age. sm_oh_A_young.raw &lt;- sm_oh_A %&gt;% filter(agegroup %in% c(&quot;18-24&quot;, &quot;25-29&quot;, &quot;30-34&quot;, &quot;35-39&quot;, &quot;40-44&quot;, &quot;45-49&quot;)) %&gt;% droplevels() sm_oh_A_young.raw %&gt;% select(physhealth, bmi, smoke100, agegroup) %&gt;% summary physhealth bmi smoke100 agegroup Min. : 0.000 Min. : 12.71 Min. :0.0000 18-24:243 1st Qu.: 0.000 1st Qu.: 23.50 1st Qu.:0.0000 25-29:220 Median : 0.000 Median : 26.69 Median :0.0000 30-34:282 Mean : 2.741 Mean : 28.21 Mean :0.3676 35-39:241 3rd Qu.: 2.000 3rd Qu.: 31.39 3rd Qu.:1.0000 40-44:285 Max. :30.000 Max. :110.88 Max. :1.0000 45-49:364 Now, let’s look more closely at the distribution of these variables, starting with our outcome. 18.3.2 Distribution of the Outcome What’s the distribution of physhealth? ggplot(sm_oh_A_young.raw, aes(x = physhealth)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = &quot;red&quot;, col = &quot;white&quot;) sm_oh_A_young.raw %&gt;% count(physhealth == 0, physhealth == 30) # A tibble: 3 x 3 `physhealth == 0` `physhealth == 30` n &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;int&gt; 1 FALSE FALSE 459 2 FALSE TRUE 66 3 TRUE FALSE 1110 Most of our respondents said zero, the minimum allowable value, although there is also a much smaller bump at 30, the maximum value we will allow. Dealing with this distribution is going to be a bit of a challenge. We will develop a series of potential modeling approaches for this sort of data, but before we do that, let’s look at the distribution of our other two variables, and the pairwise associations, in a scatterplot matrix. 18.3.3 Initial Scatterplot Matrix GGally::ggpairs(sm_oh_A_young.raw %&gt;% select(bmi, smoke100, physhealth)) 18.3.4 Dropping the subject with an unreasonably large bmi It looks like there is a very large outlier in the bmi data. This subject appears to be a full 40 kg/m2 larger than the next largest subject. Without a good explanation for that discrepancy, I will remove that subject before fitting models. I’m also going to center the bmi variable to help me interpret the final models later. sm_oh_A_young &lt;- sm_oh_A_young.raw %&gt;% mutate(bmi_c = bmi - mean(bmi)) %&gt;% filter(bmi &lt; 80) nrow(sm_oh_A_young) [1] 1634 18.3.5 Revised (Final) Scatterplot Matrix Now, here’s the revised scatterplot matrix for those 1634 subjects, now using the centered bmi data captured in the bmi_c variable. GGally::ggpairs(sm_oh_A_young %&gt;% select(bmi_c, smoke100, physhealth)) So bmi_c and smoke100 each have modest positive correlations with physhealth and only a very small correlation with each other. Here are some summary statistics for this final data. 18.3.6 Summary of the final subset of data Remember that since the mean of bmi is 28.2, the bmi_c values are just bmi - 28.2 for each subject. sm_oh_A_young %&gt;% select(bmi, bmi_c, smoke100, physhealth) %&gt;% skim() Skim summary statistics n obs: 1634 n variables: 4 Variable type: integer variable missing complete n mean sd p0 p25 median p75 p100 physhealth 0 1634 1634 2.74 6.77 0 0 0 2 30 smoke100 0 1634 1634 0.37 0.48 0 0 0 1 1 Variable type: numeric variable missing complete n mean sd p0 p25 median p75 bmi 0 1634 1634 28.16 6.84 12.71 23.5 26.69 31.39 bmi_c 0 1634 1634 -0.051 6.84 -15.5 -4.72 -1.53 3.18 p100 66.06 37.85 18.4 Modeling Strategies Explored Here We are going to predict physhealth using bmi_c and smoke100. Remember that physhealth is a count of the number of poor physical health days in the past 30. As a result, physhealth is restricted to taking values between 0 and 30. We will demonstrate the use of each of the following regression models, some of which are better choices than others. Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) predicting physhealth OLS predicting the logarithm of (physhealth + 1) Poisson regression, which is appropriate for predicting counts Poisson regression, adjusted to account for overdispersion Negative binomial regression, also used for counts and which adjusts for overdispersion Zero-inflated models, in both the Poisson and Negative Binomial varieties, which allow us to fit counts that have lots of zero values A “hurdle” model, which allows us to separately fit a model to predict the incidence of “0” and then a separate model to predict the value of physhealth when we know it is not zero Tobit regression, where a lower (and upper) bound may be set, but the underlying model describes a latent variable which can extend beyond these boundaries 18.4.1 What Will We Demonstrate? With each approach, we will fit the model and specify procedures for doing so in R. Then we will: Specify the fitted model equation Interpret the model’s coefficient estimates and 95% confidence intervals around those estimates. Perform a test of whether each variable adds value to the model, when the other one is already included. Store the fitted values and appropriate residuals for each model. Summarize the model’s apparent R2 value, the proportion of variation explained, and the model log likelihood. Perform checks of model assumptions as appropriate. Describe how predictions would be made for two new subjects. Harry has a BMI that is 10 kg/m2 higher than the average across all respondents and has smoked more than 100 cigarettes in his life. Sally has a BMI that is 5 kg/m2 less than the average across all respondents and has not smoked more than 100 cigarettes in her life. In addition, for some of the new models, we provide a little of the mathematical background, and point to other resources you can use to learn more about the model. 18.4.2 Extra Data File for Harry and Sally To make our lives a little easier, I’ll create a little tibble containing the necessary data for Harry and Sally. hs_data &lt;- data_frame(subj = c(&quot;Harry&quot;, &quot;Sally&quot;), bmi_c = c(10, -5), smoke100 = c(1, 0)) hs_data # A tibble: 2 x 3 subj bmi_c smoke100 &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 Harry 10. 1. 2 Sally -5. 0. 18.5 The OLS Approach mod_ols1 &lt;- lm(physhealth ~ bmi_c + smoke100, data = sm_oh_A_young) summary(mod_ols1) Call: lm(formula = physhealth ~ bmi_c + smoke100, data = sm_oh_A_young) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -8.320 -3.119 -1.715 -0.722 29.364 Coefficients: Estimate Std.

The bmi_c coefficient, 0.15, indicates that for each additional kg/m2 of BMI, while holding smoke100 constant, the predicted physhealth value increases by 0.15 day. The smoke100 coefficient, 2.03, indicates that a subject who has smoked 100 cigarettes or more has a predicted physhealth value 2.03 days larger than another subject with the same bmi but who has not smoked 100 cigarettes. 18.5.3 Testing the Predictors We can use the t test results provided above to assess the significance of each term, after the other is already included in the model. Each p value is well below our usual \\(\\alpha\\) levels, so we conclude that each predictor adds statistically detectable predictive value to the model. 18.5.4 Store fitted values and residuals We can use broom to do this. Here, for instance, is a table of the first six predictions and residuals. sm_ols_1 &lt;- augment(mod_ols1, sm_oh_A_young) sm_ols_1 %&gt;% select(physhealth, .fitted, .resid) %&gt;% head() physhealth .fitted .resid 1 0 1.767314 -1.7673143 2 0 2.912048 -2.9120475 3 0 1.619064 -1.6190645 4 2 2.219706 -0.2197055 5 4 5.427710 -1.4277096 6 6 1.397454 4.6025461 It turns out that 3 of the 1634 predictions that we make are below 0, and the largest prediction made by this model is 9.82 days. 18.5.5 Specify the R2 and log(likelihood) values The glance function in the broom package gives us the raw and adjusted R2 values, and the model log(likelihood), among other summaries. glance(mod_ols1) %&gt;% round(3) r.squared adj.r.squared sigma statistic p.value df logLik AIC 1 0.047 0.046 6.612 40.321 0 3 -5403.463 10814.93 BIC deviance df.residual 1 10836.52 71303.07 1631 Here, we have Model R2 log(likelihood) OLS .047 -5409.3 18.5.6 Check model assumptions Here is a plot of the residuals vs. the fitted values for this OLS model. ggplot(sm_ols_1, aes(x = .fitted, y = .resid)) + geom_point() + labs(title = &quot;Residuals vs. Fitted Values for OLS model&quot;) As usual, we can check OLS assumptions (linearity, homoscedasticity and normality) with R’s complete set of residual plots. par(mfrow = c(2,2)) plot(mod_ols1) par(mfrow = c(1,1)) We see the problem with our residuals.

Since we have undefined values when we take the log of 0, we’ll add one to each of the physhealth values before taking logs, and then transform back when we want to make predictions. mod_ols_log1 &lt;- lm(log(physhealth + 1) ~ bmi_c + smoke100, data = sm_oh_A_young) summary(mod_ols_log1) Call: lm(formula = log(physhealth + 1) ~ bmi_c + smoke100, data = sm_oh_A_young) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.4934 -0.6119 -0.3893 0.3721 3.1911 Coefficients: Estimate Std.

We can exponentiate to see that the prediction for (physhealth + 1) here is exp(0.48) = 1.62 so the predicted physhealth for a subject with average BMI who has not smoked 100 cigarettes is 0.62 days. The bmi_c coefficient, 0.15, indicates that for each additional kg/m2 of BMI, while holding smoke100 constant, the predicted logarithm of (physhealth + 1) increases by 0.026 The smoke100 coefficient, 0.28, indicates that a subject who has smoked 100 cigarettes or more has a predicted log of (physhealth + 1) value that is 0.28 larger than another subject with the same bmi but who has not smoked 100 cigarettes. 18.6.3 Testing the Predictors We are still fitting an OLS model here, so we can still use the t test results provided above to assess the significance of each term, after the other is already included in the model. Each p value is well below our usual \\(\\alpha\\) levels, so we conclude that each predictor adds statistically detectable predictive value to the model. 18.6.4 Store fitted values and residuals We can use broom to help us with this. Here, for instance, is a table of the first six predictions and residuals, on the scale of our transformed response, log(physhealth + 1). sm_ols_log1 &lt;- augment(mod_ols_log1, sm_oh_A_young) sm_ols_log1 &lt;- sm_ols_log1 %&gt;% mutate(outcome = log(physhealth + 1)) sm_ols_log1 %&gt;% select(physhealth, outcome, .fitted, .resid) %&gt;% head() physhealth outcome .fitted .resid 1 0 0.000000 0.4370723 -0.4370723 2 0 0.000000 0.6336377 -0.6336377 3 0 0.000000 0.4116159 -0.4116159 4 2 1.098612 0.5147537 0.5838586 5 4 1.609438 1.0656093 0.5438286 6 6 1.945910 0.3735625 1.5723477 Note that the outcome used in this model is log(physhealth + 1), so the .fitted and .resid values react to that outcome, and not to our original physhealth. Another option would be to calculate the model-predicted physhealth, which I’ll call ph for a moment, with the formula: \\[ ph = e^{.fitted} - 1 \\] sm_ols_log1 &lt;- sm_ols_log1 %&gt;% mutate(pred.physhealth = exp(.fitted) - 1, res.physhealth = physhealth - pred.physhealth) sm_ols_log1 %&gt;% select(physhealth, pred.physhealth, res.physhealth) %&gt;% head() physhealth pred.physhealth res.physhealth 1 0 0.5481679 -0.5481679 2 0 0.8844532 -0.8844532 3 0 0.5092545 -0.5092545 4 2 0.6732263 1.3267737 5 4 1.9026070 2.0973930 6 6 0.4529013 5.5470987 It turns out that 0 of the 1634 predictions that we make are below 0, and the largest prediction made by this model is 4.76 days. 18.6.5 Specify the R2 and log(likelihood) values The glance function in the broom package gives us the raw and adjusted R2 values, and the model log(likelihood), among other summaries. glance(mod_ols_log1) %&gt;% round(3) r.squared adj.r.squared sigma statistic p.value df logLik AIC 1 0.054 0.053 0.966 46.376 0 3 -2260.022 4528.044 BIC deviance df.residual 1 4549.639 1521.046 1631 Here, we have Model Scale R2 log(likelihood) OLS on log log(physhealth + 1) .054 -2262.0 18.6.6 Getting R2 on the scale of physhealth We could find the correlation of our model-predicted physhealth values, after back-transformation, and our observed physhealth values, if we wanted to, and then square that to get a sort of R2 value. But this model is not linear in physhealth, of course, so it’s not completely comparable to our prior OLS model. 18.6.7 Check model assumptions As usual, we can check OLS assumptions (linearity, homoscedasticity and normality) with R’s complete set of residual plots. Of course, these residuals and fitted values are now on the log(physhealth + 1) scale. par(mfrow = c(2,2)) plot(mod_ols_log1) par(mfrow = c(1,1)) 18.6.8 Predictions for Harry and Sally predict(mod_ols_log1, newdata = hs_data, interval = &quot;prediction&quot;, type = &quot;response&quot;) fit lwr upr 1 1.020009 -0.8768604 2.916877 2 0.346570 -1.5487692 2.241909 Again, these predictions are on the log(physhealth + 1) scale, and so we have to exponentiate them, and then subtract 1, to see them on the original physhealth scale. exp(predict(mod_ols_log1, newdata = hs_data, interval = &quot;prediction&quot;, type = &quot;response&quot;)) - 1 fit lwr upr 1 1.7732184 -0.5839128 17.483482 2 0.4142084 -0.7874906 8.411281 The prediction for Harry is now 1.77 days, and for Sally is 0.41 days. The prediction intervals for each again include some values below 0, which is the smallest possible value. 18.7 A Poisson Regression Model The physhealth data describe a count. Specifically a count of the number of days where the subject felt poorly in the last 30. Why wouldn’t we model this count with linear regression? A count can only be positive. Linear regression would estimate some subjects as having negative counts. A count is unlikely to follow a Normal distribution. In fact, it’s far more likely that the log of the counts will follow a Poisson distribution. So, we’ll try that. The Poisson distribution is used to model a count outcome - that is, an outcome with possible values (0, 1, 2, …). The model takes a somewhat familiar form to the models we’ve used for linear and logistic regression12. If our outcome is y and our linear predictors X, then the model is: \\[ y_i \\sim \\mbox{Poisson}(\\lambda_i) \\] The parameter \\(\\lambda\\) must be positive, so it makes sense to fit a linear regression on the logarithm of this… \\[ \\lambda_i = exp(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + ... \\beta_k X_k) \\] The coefficients \\(\\beta\\) can be exponentiated and treated as multiplicative effects. We’ll run a generalized linear model with a log link function, ensuring that all of the predicted values will be positive, and using a Poisson error distribution. This is called Poisson regression. Poisson regression may be appropriate when the dependent variable is a count of events. The events must be independent - the occurrence of one event must not make any other more or less likely. That’s hard to justify in our case, but we can take a look. mod_poiss1 &lt;- glm(physhealth ~ bmi_c + smoke100, family = poisson(), data = sm_oh_A_young) summary(mod_poiss1) Call: glm(formula = physhealth ~ bmi_c + smoke100, family = poisson(), data = sm_oh_A_young) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -5.0671 -2.3418 -1.8163 -0.7165 11.4801 Coefficients: Estimate Std.

We interpret the coefficients as follows: The constant term, 0.63, gives us the intercept of the regression - the prediction if smoke100 = 0 and bmi_c = 0. In this case, because we’ve centered BMI, it implies that exp(0.63) = 1.88 is the predicted days of poor physhealth for a non-smoker with average BMI. The coefficient of bmi_c, 0.043, is the expected difference in count of poor physhealth days (on the log scale) for each additional kg/m2 of body mass index. The expected multiplicative increase is \\(e^{0.043}\\) = 1.044, corresponding to a 4.4% difference in the count. The coefficient of smoke100, 0.71, tells us that the predictive difference between those who have and who have not smoked 100 cigarettes can be found by multiplying the physhealth count by exp(0.71) = 2.03, yielding essentially a doubling of the physhealth count. As with linear or logistic regression, each coefficient is interpreted as a comparison where one predictor changes by one unit, while the others remain constant. 18.7.3 Testing the Predictors We can use the Wald tests (z tests) provided with the Poisson regression output, or we can fit the model and then run an ANOVA to obtain a test based on the deviance (a simple transformation of the log likelihood ratio.) By the Wald tests shown above, each predictor clearly adds significant predictive value to the model given the other predictor, and we note that the p values are as small as R will support. The ANOVA approach for this model lets us check the impact of adding smoke100 to a model already containing bmi_c. anova(mod_poiss1, test = &quot;Chisq&quot;) Analysis of Deviance Table Model: poisson, link: log Response: physhealth Terms added sequentially (first to last) Df Deviance Resid.

We might deal with the overdispersion we see in this model by changing the nature of the tests we run within this model, using the coeftest or coefci approaches from the lmtest package, as I’ll demonstrate next, or we might refit the model using a quasi-likelihood approach, as I’ll show in the material to come. Here, we’ll use the coeftest and coefci approach from lmtest combined with robust sandwich estimation (via the sandwich package) to re-compute the Wald tests. coeftest(mod_poiss1, vcov. = sandwich) z test of coefficients: Estimate Std.

Later, we’ll fit this approach by changing the estimation method to a quasi-likelihood approach. 18.7.5 Store fitted values and residuals What happens if we try using the broom package in this case? We can, if we like, get our residuals and predicted values right on the scale of our physhealth response. sm_poiss1 &lt;- augment(mod_poiss1, sm_oh_A_young, type.predict = &quot;response&quot;, type.residuals = &quot;response&quot;) sm_poiss1 %&gt;% select(physhealth, .fitted, .resid) %&gt;% head() physhealth .fitted .resid 1 0 1.763823 -1.763822711 2 0 2.438787 -2.438787228 3 0 1.691340 -1.691340221 4 2 2.004777 -0.004777456 5 4 4.970699 -0.970699342 6 6 1.588506 4.411493544 18.7.6 Rootogram: see the fit of a count regression model A rootogram is a very useful way to visualize the fit of a count regression model13. The rootogram function in the countreg package makes this pretty straightforward. By default, this fits a hanging rootogram on the square root of the frequencies. rootogram(mod_poiss1, max = 30) The red curved line is the theoretical Poisson fit. “Hanging” from each point on the red line is a bar, the height of which represents the difference between expected and observed counts. A bar hanging below 0 indicates underfitting. A bar hanging above 0 indicates overfitting. The counts have been transformed with a square root transformation to prevent smaller counts from getting obscured and overwhelmed by larger counts. We see a great deal of underfitting for counts of 0, and overfitting for most other counts, especially 1-6, with some underfitting again by physhealth above 14 days. 18.7.7 Specify the R2 and log(likelihood) values We can calculate the R2 as the squared correlation of the fitted values and the observed values. # The correlation of observed and fitted values (poiss_r &lt;- with(sm_poiss1, cor(physhealth, .fitted))) [1] 0.2217254 # R-square poiss_r^2 [1] 0.04916215 The glance function in the broom package gives us model log(likelihood), among other summaries. glance(mod_poiss1) %&gt;% round(3) null.deviance df.null logLik AIC BIC deviance df.residual 1 15034.01 1633 -7835.914 15677.83 15694.02 13880.47 1631 Here, we have Model Scale R2 log(likelihood) Poisson log(physhealth) .049 -7841.69 18.7.8 Check model assumptions The Poisson model is a classical generalized linear model, estimated using the method of maximum likelihood. While the default plot option for a glm still shows the plots we would use to assess the assumptions of an OLS model, we don’t actually get much from that, since our Poisson model has different assumptions. It can be useful to look at a plot of residuals vs. fitted values on the original physhealth scale. ggplot(sm_poiss1, aes(x = .fitted, y = .resid)) + geom_point() + labs(title = &quot;Residuals vs. Fitted `physhealth`&quot;, subtitle = &quot;Original Poisson Regression model&quot;) 18.7.9 Using glm.diag.plots from the boot package The glm.diag.plots function from the boot package makes a series of diagnostic plots for generalized linear models. (Top, Left) Jackknife deviance residuals against fitted values. This is essentially identical to what you obtain with plot(mod_poiss1, which = 1). A jackknife deviance residual is also called a likelihood residual. It is the change in deviance when this observation is omitted from the data. (Top, Right) Normal Q-Q plot of standardized deviance residuals. (Dotted line shows expectation if those standardized residuals followed a Normal distribution, and these residuals generally should.) The result is similar to what you obtain with plot(mod_poiss1, which = 2). (Bottom, Left) Cook statistic vs. standardized leverage n = # of observations, p = # of parameters estimated Horizontal dotted line is at \\(\\frac{8}{n - 2p}\\). Points above the line have high influence on the model. Vertical line is at \\(\\frac{2p}{n - 2p}\\). Points to the right of the line have high leverage. (Bottom, Right) Index plot of Cook’s statistic to help identify the observations with high influence. This is essentially the same plot as plot(mod_poiss1, which = 4) glm.diag.plots(mod_poiss1) When working with these plots, it is possible to use the iden command to perform some interactive identification of points in your R terminal. But that doesn’t play out effectively in an HTML summary document like this, so we’ll leave that out. 18.7.10 Predictions for Harry and Sally The predictions from a glm fit like this don’t include prediction intervals. But we can get predictions on the scale of our original response variable, physhealth, like this. predict(mod_poiss1, newdata = hs_data, se.fit = TRUE, type = &quot;response&quot;) $fit 1 2 5.882808 1.519376 $se.fit 1 2 0.13739453 0.03858279 $residual.scale [1] 1 By using response as the type, these predictions fall on the original physhealth scale. The prediction for Harry is now 5.87 days, and for Sally is 1.52 days. 18.8 Overdispersion in a Poisson Model Poisson regressions do not supply an independent variance parameter \\(\\sigma\\), and as a result can be overdispersed, and usually are. Under the Poisson distribution, the variance equals the mean - so the standard deviation equals the square root of the mean. The notion of overdispersion arises here. When fitting generalized linear models with Poisson error distributions, the residual deviance and its degrees of freedom should be approximately equal if the model fits well. If the residual deviance is far greater than the degrees of freedom, then overdispersion may well be a problem. In this case, the residual deviance is about 8.5 times the size of the residual degrees of freedom, so that’s a clear indication of overdispersion. We saw earlier that the Poisson regression model requires that the outcome (here the physhealth counts) be independent. A possible reason for the overdispersion we see here is that physhealth on different days likely do not occur independently of one another but likely “cluster” together. 18.8.1 Testing for Overdispersion? Gelman and Hill provide an overdispersion test in R for a Poisson model as follows… yhat &lt;- predict(mod_poiss1, type = &quot;response&quot;) n &lt;- arm::display(mod_poiss1)$n glm(formula = physhealth ~ bmi_c + smoke100, family = poisson(), data = sm_oh_A_young) coef.est coef.se (Intercept) 0.63 0.02 bmi_c 0.04 0.00 smoke100 0.70 0.03 --- n = 1634, k = 3 residual deviance = 13880.5, null deviance = 15034.0 (difference = 1153.5) k &lt;- arm::display(mod_poiss1)$k glm(formula = physhealth ~ bmi_c + smoke100, family = poisson(), data = sm_oh_A_young) coef.est coef.se (Intercept) 0.63 0.02 bmi_c 0.04 0.00 smoke100 0.70 0.03 --- n = 1634, k = 3 residual deviance = 13880.5, null deviance = 15034.0 (difference = 1153.5) z &lt;- (sm_oh_A_young$physhealth - yhat) / sqrt(yhat) cat(&quot;overdispersion ratio is &quot;, sum(z^2)/ (n - k), &quot;\\n&quot;) overdispersion ratio is 15.49983 cat(&quot;p value of overdispersion test is &quot;, pchisq(sum(z^2), df = n-k, lower.tail = FALSE), &quot;\\n&quot;) p value of overdispersion test is 0 The p value here is 0, indicating that the probability is essentially zero that a random variable from a \\(\\chi^2\\) distribution with (n - k) = 1633 degrees of freedom would be as large as what we observed in this case. So there is significant overdispersion. In summary, the polyps counts are overdispersed by a factor of 15.499, which is enormous (even a factor of 2 would be considered large) and also highly statistically significant. The basic correction for overdisperson is to multiply all regression standard errors by \\(\\sqrt{15.499}\\) = 3.94. The quasipoisson model and the negative binomial model that we’ll fit below are very similar. We write the overdispersed “quasiPoisson” model as: \\[ y_i \\sim \\mbox{overdispersed Poisson} (\\mu_i exp(X_i \\beta), \\omega) \\] where \\(\\omega\\) is the overdispersion parameter, 15.499, in our case. The Poisson model we saw previously is then just the overdispersed Poisson model with \\(\\omega = 1\\). 18.9 Fitting the Quasi-Poisson Model To deal with overdispersion, one useful approach is to apply a quasi-likelihood estimation procedure, as follows: mod_poiss_od1 &lt;- glm(physhealth ~ bmi_c + smoke100, family = quasipoisson(), data = sm_oh_A_young) summary(mod_poiss_od1) Call: glm(formula = physhealth ~ bmi_c + smoke100, family = quasipoisson(), data = sm_oh_A_young) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -5.0671 -2.3418 -1.8163 -0.7165 11.4801 Coefficients: Estimate Std.

Sometimes, though I won’t demonstrate this here, people fit an “adjusted” Poisson regression model, where this estimation by quasi-ML is augmented to adjust the inference via sandwich estimates of the covariances14. 18.9.1 The Fitted Equation The model equation is still log(physhealth) = 0.63 + 0.04 bmi_c + 0.71 smoke100. The estimated coefficients are still statistically significant, but the standard errors for each coefficient are considerably larger when we account for overdispersion. The dispersion parameter for the quasi-Poisson family is now taken to be a bit less than the square root of the ratio of the residual deviance and its degrees of freedom. This is a much more believable model, as a result. 18.9.2 Interpreting the Coefficients No meaningful change from the Poisson model we saw previously. The constant term, 0.63, gives us the intercept of the regression - the prediction if smoke100 = 0 and bmi_c = 0. In this case, because we’ve centered BMI, it implies that exp(0.63) = 1.88 is the predicted days of poor physhealth for a non-smoker with average BMI. The coefficient of bmi_c, 0.043, is the expected difference in count of poor physhealth days (on the log scale) for each additional kg/m2 of body mass index. The expected multiplicative increase is \\(e^{0.043}\\) = 1.044, corresponding to a 4.4% difference in the count. The coefficient of smoke100, 0.71, tells us that the predictive difference between those who have and who have not smoked 100 cigarettes can be found by multiplying the physhealth count by exp(0.71) = 2.03, yielding essentially a doubling of the physhealth count. 18.9.3 Testing the Predictors Again, we can use the Wald tests (z tests) provided with the Poisson regression output, or we can fit the model and then run an ANOVA to obtain a test based on the deviance (a simple transformation of the log likelihood ratio.) By the Wald tests shown above, each predictor clearly adds significant predictive value to the model given the other predictor, and we note that the p values are as small as R will support. The ANOVA approach for this model lets us check the impact of adding smoke100 to a model already containing bmi_c. anova(mod_poiss_od1, test = &quot;Chisq&quot;) Analysis of Deviance Table Model: quasipoisson, link: log Response: physhealth Terms added sequentially (first to last) Df Deviance Resid.

To obtain a p value for smoke100’s impact after bmi_c is accounted for, we compare the difference in deviance to a chi-square distribution with 1 degree of freedom. The result is incredibly statistically significant. To check the effect of bmi_c, we could refit the model with and without bmi_c, and again run an ANOVA. I’ll skip that here. 18.9.4 Store fitted values and residuals What happens if we try using the broom package in this case? We can, if we like, get our residuals and predicted values right on the scale of our physhealth response. sm_poiss_od1 &lt;- augment(mod_poiss_od1, sm_oh_A_young, type.predict = &quot;response&quot;, type.residuals = &quot;response&quot;) sm_poiss_od1 %&gt;% select(physhealth, .fitted, .resid) %&gt;% head() physhealth .fitted .resid 1 0 1.763823 -1.763822711 2 0 2.438787 -2.438787228 3 0 1.691340 -1.691340221 4 2 2.004777 -0.004777456 5 4 4.970699 -0.970699342 6 6 1.588506 4.411493544 It turns out that 0 of the 1634 predictions that we make are below 0, and the largest prediction made by this model is 19.62 days. The rootogram function we’ve shown doesn’t support overdispersed Poisson models at the moment. 18.9.5 Specify the R2 and log(likelihood) values We can calculate the R2 as the squared correlation of the fitted values and the observed values. # The correlation of observed and fitted values (poiss_od_r &lt;- with(sm_poiss_od1, cor(physhealth, .fitted))) [1] 0.2217254 # R-square poiss_od_r^2 [1] 0.04916215 The glance function in the broom package gives us model log(likelihood), among other summaries. glance(mod_poiss_od1) %&gt;% round(3) null.deviance df.null logLik AIC BIC deviance df.residual 1 15034.01 1633 NA NA NA 13880.47 1631 Here, we have Model Scale R2 log(likelihood) Poisson log(physhealth) .049 NA 18.9.6 Check model assumptions Having dealt with the overdispersion, this should be a cleaner model in some ways, but the diagnostics (other than the dispersion) will be the same. Here is a plot of residuals vs. fitted values on the original physhealth scale. ggplot(sm_poiss_od1, aes(x = .fitted, y = .resid)) + geom_point() + labs(title = &quot;Residuals vs. Fitted `physhealth`&quot;, subtitle = &quot;Overdispersed Poisson Regression model&quot;) I’ll skip the glm.diag.plots results, since you’ve already seen them. 18.9.7 Predictions for Harry and Sally The predictions from this overdispersed Poisson regression will match those in the original Poisson regression, but the standard error will be larger. predict(mod_poiss_od1, newdata = hs_data, se.fit = TRUE, type = &quot;response&quot;) $fit 1 2 5.882808 1.519376 $se.fit 1 2 0.5409199 0.1518998 $residual.scale [1] 3.936983 By using response as the type, these predictions fall on the original physhealth scale. Again, the prediction for Harry is 5.87 days, and for Sally is 1.52 days. 18.10 Poisson and Quasi-Poisson models using Glm from the rms package The Glm function in the rms package can be used to fit both the original Poisson regression and the quasi-Poisson model accounting for overdispersion. 18.10.1 Refitting the original Poisson regression with Glm d &lt;- datadist(sm_oh_A_young) options(datadist = &quot;d&quot;) mod_poi_Glm_1 &lt;- Glm(physhealth ~ bmi_c + smoke100, family = poisson(), data = sm_oh_A_young, x = T, y = T) mod_poi_Glm_1 General Linear Model Glm(formula = physhealth ~ bmi_c + smoke100, family = poisson(), data = sm_oh_A_young, x = T, y = T) Model Likelihood Ratio Test Obs 1634 LR chi2 1153.54 Residual d.f.1631 d.f. 2 g 0.5185238 Pr(&gt; chi2) &lt;0.0001 Coef S.E.

What’s that doing? 18.11 Negative Binomial Model Another approach to dealing with overdispersion is to fit a negative binomial model15 to predict the log(physhealth) counts. This involves the fitting of an additional parameter, \\(\\theta\\). That’s our dispersion parameter16 Sometimes, people will fit a model where \\(\\theta\\) is known, for instance a geometric model (where \\(\\theta\\) = 1), and then this can be directly plugged into a glm() fit, but the more common scenario is that we are going to iteratively estimate the \\(\\beta\\) coefficients and \\(\\theta\\). To do this, I’ll use the glm.nb function from the MASS package. mod_nb1 &lt;- MASS::glm.nb(physhealth ~ bmi_c + smoke100, link = log, data = sm_oh_A_young) summary(mod_nb1) Call: MASS::glm.nb(formula = physhealth ~ bmi_c + smoke100, data = sm_oh_A_young, link = log, init.theta = 0.1343652349) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.1087 -0.9046 -0.8288 -0.1662 2.2323 Coefficients: Estimate Std.

Note that the Poisson model is a subset of the negative binomial. logLik(mod_nb1) &#39;log Lik.&#39; -2581.68 (df=4) logLik(mod_poiss1) &#39;log Lik.&#39; -7835.914 (df=3) pchisq(2 * (logLik(mod_nb1) - logLik(mod_poiss1)), df = 1, lower.tail = FALSE) &#39;log Lik.&#39; 0 (df=4) Here, the difference in the log likelihoods, multiplied by 2, is 10512 with 1 degree of freedom. This strongly suggests that the negative binomial model, estimating the dispersion parameter, is more appropriate than the raw Poisson model. However, both the regression coefficients and the standard errors are rather similar to the quasi-Poisson and the sandwich-adjusted Poisson results above. Thus, in terms of predicted means, all three models give very similar results; the associated Wald tests also lead to the same conclusions. 18.11.3 Interpreting the Coefficients There’s only a small change here from the Poisson models we saw previously. The constant term, 0.61, gives us the intercept of the regression - the prediction if smoke100 = 0 and bmi_c = 0. In this case, because we’ve centered BMI, it implies that exp(0.61) = 1.84 is the predicted days of poor physhealth for a non-smoker with average BMI. The coefficient of bmi_c, 0.043, is the expected difference in count of poor physhealth days (on the log scale) for each additional kg/m2 of body mass index. The expected multiplicative increase is \\(e^{0.043}\\) = 1.044, corresponding to a 4.4% difference in the count. The coefficient of smoke100, 0.756, tells us that the predictive difference between those who have and who have not smoked 100 cigarettes can be found by multiplying the physhealth count by exp(0.756) = 2.13, yielding essentially a doubling of the physhealth count. 18.11.4 Interpretation of Coefficients in terms of IRRs We might be interested in looking at incident rate ratios rather than coefficients. The coefficients have an additive effect in the log(y) scale, and the IRR have a multiplicative effect in the y scale. To do this, we can exponentiate our model coefficients. This also applies to the confidence intervals. exp(coef(mod_nb1)) (Intercept) bmi_c smoke100 1.842189 1.043292 2.132374 exp(confint(mod_nb1)) Waiting for profiling to be done... 2.5 % 97.5 % (Intercept) 1.556759 2.198628 bmi_c 1.024660 1.063437 smoke100 1.613928 2.835440 As an example, then, the incident rate for smoke100 = 1 is 2.13 times the incident rate of physhealth days for the reference group (smoke100 = 0). The percent change in the incident rate of physhealth is a 4.3% increase for every kg/m2 increase in centered bmi. 18.11.5 Testing the Predictors Again, we can use the Wald tests (z tests) provided with the negative binomial regression output. As an alternative, we probably should not use the standard anova process, because the models there don’t re-estimate \\(\\theta\\) for each new model, as the warning message below indicates. anova(mod_nb1) Warning in anova.negbin(mod_nb1): tests made without re-estimating &#39;theta&#39; Analysis of Deviance Table Model: Negative Binomial(0.1344), link: log Response: physhealth Terms added sequentially (first to last) Df Deviance Resid.

We’ll look here at residuals and predicted (fitted) values on the scale of our physhealth response. sm_nb1 &lt;- augment(mod_nb1, sm_oh_A_young, type.predict = &quot;response&quot;, type.residuals = &quot;response&quot;) sm_nb1 %&gt;% select(physhealth, .fitted, .resid) %&gt;% head() physhealth .fitted .resid 1 0 1.724956 -1.72495599 2 0 2.369399 -2.36939884 3 0 1.655481 -1.65548138 4 2 1.955507 0.04449258 5 4 4.759915 -0.75991504 6 6 1.556811 4.44318950 18.11.7 Rootogram for Negative Binomial model Here’s the rootogram for the negative binomial model. rootogram(mod_nb1, max = 30) Again, the red curved line is the theoretical (negative binomial) fit. “Hanging” from each point on the red line is a bar, the height of which represents the difference between expected and observed counts. A bar hanging below 0 indicates underfitting. A bar hanging above 0 indicates overfitting. The counts have been transformed with a square root transformation to prevent smaller counts from getting obscured and overwhelmed by larger counts. The match looks much better than the Poisson model, which is a sign that accounting for overdispersion is very important. Even this model badly underfits the number of 30 values, however. 18.11.8 Simulating what the Negative Binomial model predicts We can use the parameters of the negative binomial model to simulate data17 and compare the simulated results to our observed physhealth data. par(mfrow=c(1,2)) sm_oh_A_young$physhealth %&gt;% table() %&gt;% barplot(main = &quot;Observed physhealth&quot;) set.seed(432122) rnbinom(n = nrow(sm_oh_A_young), size = mod_nb1$theta, mu = exp(coef(mod_nb1)[1])) %&gt;% table() %&gt;% barplot(main = &quot;Simulated physhealth&quot;) Again we see that the simulated data badly underfits the 30 values, and includes some predictions larger than 30. 18.11.9 Specify the R2 and log(likelihood) values We can calculate the R2 as the squared correlation of the fitted values and the observed values. # The correlation of observed and fitted values (nb_r &lt;- with(sm_nb1, cor(physhealth, .fitted))) [1] 0.220983 # R-square nb_r^2 [1] 0.04883348 The glance function in the broom package gives us model log(likelihood), among other summaries. glance(mod_nb1) %&gt;% round(3) null.deviance df.null logLik AIC BIC deviance df.residual 1 1132.866 1633 -2581.68 5171.36 5192.956 1081.862 1631 Here, we have Model Scale R2 log(likelihood) Negative Binomial log(physhealth) .049 -2585.6 18.11.10 Check model assumptions Here is a plot of residuals vs. fitted values on the original physhealth scale. ggplot(sm_nb1, aes(x = .fitted, y = .resid)) + geom_point() + labs(title = &quot;Residuals vs. Fitted `physhealth`&quot;, subtitle = &quot;Negative Binomial Regression model&quot;) Here are the glm diagnostic plots from the boot package. glm.diag.plots(mod_nb1) From the lower left plot, we see fewer points with large values of both Cook’s distance and leverage, so that’s a step in the right direction. The upper right plot still has some issues, but we’re closer to a desirable result there, too. 18.11.11 Predictions for Harry and Sally The predictions from this negative binomial regression model will be only a little different than those from the Poisson models. predict(mod_nb1, newdata = hs_data, se.fit = TRUE, type = &quot;response&quot;) $fit 1 2 6.001454 1.490406 $se.fit 1 2 0.8920031 0.1497235 $residual.scale [1] 1 As we’ve seen in the past, when we use response as the type, the predictions fall on the original physhealth scale. The prediction for Harry is 5.99 days, and for Sally is 1.49 days. 18.12 The Problem: Too Few Zeros Remember that we observe more than 1000 zeros in our physhealth data. sm_oh_A_young %&gt;% count(physhealth == 0) # A tibble: 2 x 2 `physhealth == 0` n &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;int&gt; 1 FALSE 525 2 TRUE 1109 Let’s go back to our Poisson model (without overdispersion) for a moment, and concentrate on the zero values. # predict expected mean physhealth for each subject mu &lt;- predict(mod_poiss1, type = &quot;response&quot;) # sum the probabilities of a zero count for each mean exp &lt;- sum(dpois(x = 0, lambda = mu)) # predicted number of zeros from Poisson model round(exp) [1] 190 As we’ve seen previously, we’re severely underfitting zero counts. We can compare the observed number of zero physhealth results to the expected number of zero values from the likelihood-based models. round(c(&quot;Obs&quot; = sum(sm_oh_A_young$physhealth == 0), &quot;Poisson&quot; = sum(dpois(0, fitted(mod_poiss1))), &quot;NB&quot; = sum(dnbinom(0, mu = fitted(mod_nb1), size = mod_nb1$theta))),0) Obs Poisson NB 1109 190 1101 There are at least two ways to tackle this problem. Fitting a model which deliberately inflates the number of zeros that are fitted Fitting a hurdle model We’ll look at those options, next. 18.13 The Zero-Inflated Poisson Regression Model The zero-inflated Poisson or (ZIP) model is used to describe count data with an excess of zero counts18. The model posits that there are two processes involved: a logit model is used to predict excess zeros while a Poisson model is used to predict the counts, generally The pscl package is used here, which can conflict with the countreg package we used to fit rootograms. That’s why I’m loading it here. library(pscl) Classes and Methods for R developed in the Political Science Computational Laboratory Department of Political Science Stanford University Simon Jackman hurdle and zeroinfl functions by Achim Zeileis Attaching package: &#39;pscl&#39; The following objects are masked from &#39;package:countreg&#39;: hurdle, hurdle.control, hurdletest, zeroinfl, zeroinfl.control To run the zero-inflated Poisson model, we use the following: mod_zip1 &lt;- zeroinfl(physhealth ~ bmi_c + smoke100, data = sm_oh_A_young) summary(mod_zip1) Call: zeroinfl(formula = physhealth ~ bmi_c + smoke100, data = sm_oh_A_young) Pearson residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.4159 -0.6461 -0.5315 -0.2562 11.0564 Count model coefficients (poisson with log link): Estimate Std.

Below the model call, we see information on a Poisson regression model. Then we see another block describing the inflation model. Each predictor (bmi_c and smoke100) appears to be statistically significant in each part of the model. 18.13.1 Comparison to a null model To show that this model fits better than the null model (the model with intercept only), we can compare them directly with a chi-squared test.

First we have a logistic regression model to predict the log odds of zero physhealth days… logit(physhealth = 0) = 0.919 - 0.051 bmi_c - 0.411 smoke100 That takes care of the extra zeros. Then, to predict the number of physhealth days, we have: log(physhealth) = 1.90 + 0.014 bmi_c + 0.441 smoke100 which may produce some additional zero count estimates. 18.13.4 Interpreting the Coefficients We can exponentiate the logistic regression coefficients to obtain results in terms of odds ratios for that model, and that can be of some help in understanding the process behind excess zeros. Also, exponentiating the coefficients of the count model help us describe those counts on the original scale of physhealth. exp(coef(mod_zip1)) count_(Intercept) count_bmi_c count_smoke100 zero_(Intercept) 6.6702090 1.0140827 1.5490495 2.5130936 zero_bmi_c zero_smoke100 0.9511312 0.6596398 For example, in the model for physhealth = 0, the odds of physhealth = 0 are 66% as high for subjects with smoke100 = 1 as for non-smokers with the same BMI. in the Poisson model for physhealth, the physhealth count is estimated to increase by 1.55 for smokers as compared to non-smokers with the same BMI. 18.13.5 Testing the Predictors We can test the model with and without bmi_c, for example, by fitting the model both ways, and comparing the results with either a Wald or Likelihood Ratio test, each of which is available in the lmtest package. mod_zip1_nobmi &lt;- zeroinfl(physhealth ~ smoke100, data = sm_oh_A_young) lmtest::waldtest(mod_zip1, mod_zip1_nobmi) Wald test Model 1: physhealth ~ bmi_c + smoke100 Model 2: physhealth ~ smoke100 Res.Df Df Chisq Pr(&gt;Chisq) 1 1628 2 1630 -2 109.3 &lt; 2.2e-16 *** --- Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 lmtest::lrtest(mod_zip1, mod_zip1_nobmi) Likelihood ratio test Model 1: physhealth ~ bmi_c + smoke100 Model 2: physhealth ~ smoke100 #Df LogLik Df Chisq Pr(&gt;Chisq) 1 6 -4178.5 2 4 -4232.0 -2 106.96 &lt; 2.2e-16 *** --- Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 18.13.6 Store fitted values and residuals The broom package does not work with the zeroinfl tool.

This will involve a logistic regression to predict the probability of a 0, and then a negative binomial model to describe the counts of physhealth.

Then, to predict the number of physhealth days, we have: log(physhealth) = 1.36 + 0.020 bmi_c + 0.575 smoke100 and there’s a \\(\\theta\\) term, which is estimated as exp(-1.023) or 0.36, and this negative binomial regression model may also produce some additional zero count estimates. 18.14.4 Interpreting the Coefficients As with the zip, we can exponentiate the logistic regression coefficients to obtain results in terms of odds ratios for that model, and that can be of some help in understanding the process behind excess zeros. exp(coef(mod_zinb1)) count_(Intercept) count_bmi_c count_smoke100 zero_(Intercept) 3.8695991 1.0206290 1.7745194 1.0423111 zero_bmi_c zero_smoke100 0.9402556 0.7091188 For example, in the model for physhealth = 0, the odds of physhealth = 0 are 71.4% as high for subjects with smoke100 = 1 as for non-smokers with the same BMI. Interpreting the negative binomial piece works the same way as it did in the negative binomial regression. 18.14.5 Testing the Predictors We can test the model with and without bmi_c, for example, by fitting the model both ways, and comparing the results with either a Wald or Likelihood Ratio test, each of which is available in the lmtest package. mod_zinb1_nobmi &lt;- zeroinfl(physhealth ~ smoke100, dist = &quot;negbin&quot;, data = sm_oh_A_young) lmtest::waldtest(mod_zinb1, mod_zinb1_nobmi) Wald test Model 1: physhealth ~ bmi_c + smoke100 Model 2: physhealth ~ smoke100 Res.Df Df Chisq Pr(&gt;Chisq) 1 1627 2 1629 -2 33.611 5.028e-08 *** --- Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 lmtest::lrtest(mod_zinb1, mod_zinb1_nobmi) Likelihood ratio test Model 1: physhealth ~ bmi_c + smoke100 Model 2: physhealth ~ smoke100 #Df LogLik Df Chisq Pr(&gt;Chisq) 1 7 -2564.3 2 5 -2587.1 -2 45.442 1.357e-10 *** --- Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 18.14.6 Store fitted values and residuals Again, we need to build up the fitted values and residuals without the broom package. sm_zinb1 &lt;- sm_oh_A_young %&gt;% mutate(fitted = fitted(mod_zinb1, type = &quot;response&quot;), resid = resid(mod_zinb1, type = &quot;response&quot;)) sm_zip1 %&gt;% dplyr::select(physhealth, fitted, resid) %&gt;% head() # A tibble: 6 x 3 physhealth fitted resid &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0 1.76 -1.76 2 0 2.53 -2.53 3 0 1.67 -1.67 4 2 2.04 -0.0357 5 4 5.02 -1.02 6 6 1.55 4.45 18.14.7 Modeled Number of Zero Counts Once again, we can compare the observed number of zero physhealth results to the expected number of zero values from the likelihood-based models. round(c(&quot;Obs&quot; = sum(sm_oh_A_young$physhealth == 0), &quot;Poisson&quot; = sum(dpois(0, fitted(mod_poiss1))), &quot;NB&quot; = sum(dnbinom(0, mu = fitted(mod_nb1), size = mod_nb1$theta)), &quot;ZIP&quot; = sum(predict(mod_zip1, type = &quot;prob&quot;)[,1]), &quot;ZINB&quot; = sum(predict(mod_zinb1, type = &quot;prob&quot;)[,1])),0) Obs Poisson NB ZIP ZINB 1109 190 1101 1109 1111 So, the Poisson model is clearly inappropriate, but the zero-inflated (Poisson and NB) and the negative binomial model all give reasonable fits in this regard. 18.14.8 Rootogram for Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial model Here’s the rootogram for the zero-inflated negative binomial model. countreg::rootogram(mod_zinb1, max = 30) As in the ZIP model, the zero frequencies are perfectly matched here, but we can see that counts of 1 and 2 are now closer to the data we observe than in the ZIP model.

The prediction for Harry is 6.01 days, and for Sally is 1.45 days. 18.15 A “hurdle” model (with Poisson) Much of the discussion here of hurdle models comes from Clay Ford at the University of Virginia20. Ford describes a hurdle model as follows: The hurdle model is a two-part model that specifies one process for zero counts and another process for positive counts. The idea is that positive counts occur once a threshold is crossed, or put another way, a hurdle is cleared. If the hurdle is not cleared, then we have a count of 0. The first part of the model is typically a binary logit model. This models whether an observation takes a positive count or not. The second part of the model is usually a truncated Poisson or Negative Binomial model. Truncated means we’re only fitting positive counts. If we were to fit a hurdle model to our [medicare] data, the interpretation would be that one process governs whether a patient visits a doctor or not, and another process governs how many visits are made. To fit a hurdle model, we’ll use the hurdle function in the pscl package. mod_hur1 &lt;- hurdle(physhealth ~ bmi_c + smoke100, dist = &quot;poisson&quot;, zero.dist = &quot;binomial&quot;, data = sm_oh_A_young) summary(mod_hur1) Call: hurdle(formula = physhealth ~ bmi_c + smoke100, data = sm_oh_A_young, dist = &quot;poisson&quot;, zero.dist = &quot;binomial&quot;) Pearson residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.4170 -0.6460 -0.5316 -0.2561 11.0526 Count model coefficients (truncated poisson with log link): Estimate Std.

First we have a logistic regression model to predict the log odds of zero physhealth days… logit(physhealth = 0) = 0.921 - 0.051 bmi_c - 0.413 smoke100 That takes care of the zeros. Then, to predict the number of physhealth days, we use the following truncated Poisson model: log(physhealth) = 1.90 + 0.014 bmi_c + 0.441 smoke100 which is truncated to produce only estimates greater than zero. 18.15.5 Interpreting the Coefficients We can exponentiate the logistic regression coefficients to obtain results in terms of odds ratios for that model, and that can be of some help in understanding the process behind excess zeros. Also, exponentiating the coefficients of the count model help us describe those counts on the original scale of physhealth. exp(coef(mod_hur1)) count_(Intercept) count_bmi_c count_smoke100 zero_(Intercept) 6.6703712 1.0140833 1.5490611 0.3971442 zero_bmi_c zero_smoke100 1.0514519 1.5187511 For example, in the model for physhealth = 0, the odds of physhealth = 0 are 151% as high for subjects with smoke100 = 1 as for non-smokers with the same BMI. in the Poisson model for physhealth, the physhealth count is estimated to increase by 1.55 for smokers as compared to non-smokers with the same BMI. 18.15.6 Testing the Predictors We can test the model with and without bmi_c, for example, by fitting the model both ways, and comparing the results with either a Wald or Likelihood Ratio test, each of which is available in the lmtest package. mod_hur1_nobmi &lt;- hurdle(physhealth ~ smoke100, dist = &quot;poisson&quot;, zero.dist = &quot;binomial&quot;, data = sm_oh_A_young) lmtest::waldtest(mod_hur1, mod_hur1_nobmi) Wald test Model 1: physhealth ~ bmi_c + smoke100 Model 2: physhealth ~ smoke100 Res.Df Df Chisq Pr(&gt;Chisq) 1 1628 2 1630 -2 109.29 &lt; 2.2e-16 *** --- Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 lmtest::lrtest(mod_hur1, mod_hur1_nobmi) Likelihood ratio test Model 1: physhealth ~ bmi_c + smoke100 Model 2: physhealth ~ smoke100 #Df LogLik Df Chisq Pr(&gt;Chisq) 1 6 -4178.5 2 4 -4232.0 -2 106.97 &lt; 2.2e-16 *** --- Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 18.15.7 Store fitted values and residuals The broom package does not work with the hurdle class of models.

All but the Poisson give reasonable fits in this regard. 18.15.9 Rootogram for Hurdle Model countreg::rootogram(mod_hur1, max = 30) The results are still not perfect, of course. In fitting the zeros exactly, we’re underfitting counts of 1, 2, and 30, and overfitting many of the counts between 6 and 20. We still have a problem here with overdispersion. That’s why we’ll consider a hurdle model with a negative binomial regression for the counts in a moment. 18.15.10 Understanding the Modeled Counts in Detail The expected mean count uses both parts of the hurdle model. Mathematically, we want… \\[ E[y | {\\bf x}] = \\frac{1 - f_1(0 | {\\bf x})}{1 - f_2(0 | {\\bf x})} \\mu_2({\\bf x}) \\] where our count of physhealth is \\(y\\) our predictors are represented by x and the expected count is the product of a ratio and a mean. The ratio is the probability of a non-zero in the first process divided the probability of a non-zero in the second untruncated process. The f symbols represent distributions. Recall these are logistic and Poisson, respectively, by default but can be others. The mean is for the untruncated version of the positive-count process. If we want to see the expected hurdle counts, we can get them using some clever applications of the predict function. The first six expected mean counts (\\(E[y | {\\bf x}]\\) from the equation above) are: head(predict(mod_hur1, type = &quot;response&quot;)) 1 2 3 4 5 6 1.756341 2.527945 1.671933 2.035348 5.018026 1.551978 The ratio of non-zero probabilities, \\(\\frac{1 - f_1(0 | {\\bf x})}{1 - f_2(0 | {\\bf x})}\\), from the mathematical expression above can be extracted by: head(predict(mod_hur1, type = &quot;zero&quot;)) 1 2 3 4 5 6 0.2690804 0.3487780 0.2596470 0.2991808 0.5499740 0.2459557 The mean for the untruncated process, \\(\\mu_2({\\bf x})\\), can also be obtained by: head(predict(mod_hur1, type = &quot;count&quot;)) 1 2 3 4 5 6 6.527200 7.248006 6.439253 6.803070 9.124116 6.309990 and we can multiply these last two pieces together to verify that they match our expected hurdle counts. head(predict(mod_hur1, type = &quot;zero&quot;) * predict(mod_hur1, type = &quot;count&quot;),5) 1 2 3 4 5 1.756341 2.527945 1.671933 2.035348 5.018026 18.15.11 Specify the R2 and log (likelihood) values We can calculate a proxy for R2 as the squared correlation of the fitted values and the observed values. # The correlation of observed and fitted values (hur1_r &lt;- with(sm_hur1, cor(physhealth, fitted))) [1] 0.2235982 # R-square hur1_r^2 [1] 0.04999615 logLik(mod_hur1) &#39;log Lik.&#39; -4178.491 (df=6) Here, we have Model Scale R2 log(likelihood) Hurdle Model (Poisson) Complex: log(physhealth) .050 -4184.1 18.15.12 Check model assumptions Here is a plot of residuals vs. fitted values on the original physhealth scale. ggplot(sm_hur1, aes(x = fitted, y = resid)) + geom_point() + labs(title = &quot;Residuals vs. Fitted `physhealth`&quot;, subtitle = &quot;Hurdle model with Poisson counts&quot;) 18.15.13 Predictions for Harry and Sally The predictions from this zero-inflated negative binomial regression model are obtained as follows… predict(mod_hur1, newdata = hs_data, type = &quot;response&quot;) 1 2 5.930506 1.471289 As we’ve seen in the past, when we use response as the type, the predictions fall on the original physhealth scale.

First we have a logistic regression model to predict the log odds of zero physhealth days… logit(physhealth = 0) = -0.921 + 0.051 bmi_c + 0.413 smoke100 That takes care of the zeros. Then, to predict the number of physhealth days, we use the following truncated negative binomial model: log(physhealth) = 1.30 + 0.018 bmi_c + 0.576 smoke100 which is truncated to produce only estimates greater than zero, with \\(\\theta\\) estimated as exp(-1.123) or 0.325. 18.16.6 Interpreting the Coefficients We can exponentiate the logistic regression coefficients to obtain results in terms of odds ratios for that model, and that can be of some help in understanding the process behind excess zeros. exp(coef(mod_hur_nb1)) count_(Intercept) count_bmi_c count_smoke100 zero_(Intercept) 3.6886473 1.0186970 1.7744998 0.3971442 zero_bmi_c zero_smoke100 1.0514519 1.5187511 For example, in the model for physhealth = 0, the odds of physhealth = 0 are 151% as high for subjects with smoke100 = 1 as for non-smokers with the same BMI. 18.16.7 Testing the Predictors We can test the model with and without bmi_c, for example, by fitting the model both ways, and comparing the results with either a Wald or Likelihood Ratio test, each of which is available in the lmtest package. mod_hurnb1_nobmi &lt;- hurdle(physhealth ~ smoke100, dist = &quot;negbin&quot;, zero.dist = &quot;binomial&quot;, data = sm_oh_A_young) lmtest::waldtest(mod_hur_nb1, mod_hurnb1_nobmi) Wald test Model 1: physhealth ~ bmi_c + smoke100 Model 2: physhealth ~ smoke100 Res.Df Df Chisq Pr(&gt;Chisq) 1 1627 2 1629 -2 46.657 7.388e-11 *** --- Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 lmtest::lrtest(mod_hur_nb1, mod_hurnb1_nobmi) Likelihood ratio test Model 1: physhealth ~ bmi_c + smoke100 Model 2: physhealth ~ smoke100 #Df LogLik Df Chisq Pr(&gt;Chisq) 1 7 -2562.9 2 5 -2587.1 -2 48.218 3.385e-11 *** --- Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 18.16.8 Store fitted values and residuals Again we need to build up the fitted values and residuals, without broom to help. sm_hur_nb1 &lt;- sm_oh_A_young %&gt;% mutate(fitted = fitted(mod_hur_nb1, type = &quot;response&quot;), resid = resid(mod_hur_nb1, type = &quot;response&quot;)) sm_hur_nb1 %&gt;% dplyr::select(physhealth, fitted, resid) %&gt;% head() # A tibble: 6 x 3 physhealth fitted resid &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0 1.74 -1.74 2 0 2.51 -2.51 3 0 1.65 -1.65 4 2 2.01 -0.0138 5 4 5.03 -1.03 6 6 1.53 4.47 18.16.9 Rootogram for NB Hurdle Model countreg::rootogram(mod_hur_nb1, max = 30) This improves the situation, but we’re still underfitting the 30s. 18.16.10 Specify the R2 and log (likelihood) values We can calculate a proxy for R2 as the squared correlation of the fitted values and the observed values. # The correlation of observed and fitted values (hurnb1_r &lt;- with(sm_hur_nb1, cor(physhealth, fitted))) [1] 0.2232941 # R-square hurnb1_r^2 [1] 0.04986026 logLik(mod_hur_nb1) &#39;log Lik.&#39; -2562.952 (df=7) Here, we have Model Scale R2 log(likelihood) Hurdle Model (Neg.

Consider the variable physhealth, which is restricted to fall between 0 and 30 by the way the measure was constructed. But supposed we think about a broader and latent (unobserved) variable describing physical health. Among the people with physhealth = 0, some would be incredible athletes and others would be in much poorer physical health but still healthy enough to truthfully answer 0. On the other end, some of the people responding 30 are in substantially worse physical health than others with that same response. Censoring from below takes place when values at or below a threshold (in this case 0) take that value. Censoring from above takes place when values at or above a threshold (here, 30) take that value. Several examples of tobit analysis are available at https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/r/dae/tobit-models/, which is my primary source for the material here on those models. The tobit model postulates that the value 0 in our model is just the lower limit of the underlying measure of poor physical health that we would actually observe in the population if we had a stronger measure. Similarly, we’ll postulate that 30 is just the upper limit of “poor health” that we can see. The approach I’ll take to run the tobit model comes from the vglm function in the VGAM package. Here’s the model, and its summary. Note that the default Lower value for a tobit model is 0, so we didn’t technically have to list that here. mod_tob1 &lt;- vglm(physhealth ~ bmi_c + smoke100, tobit(Lower = 0, Upper = 30), type.fitted = &quot;censored&quot;, data = sm_oh_A_young) summary(mod_tob1) Call: vglm(formula = physhealth ~ bmi_c + smoke100, family = tobit(Lower = 0, Upper = 30), data = sm_oh_A_young, type.fitted = &quot;censored&quot;) Pearson residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max mu -4.963 -0.6059 -0.4371 0.9127 2.558 loge(sd) -1.065 -0.3039 -0.2862 -0.1981 9.019 Coefficients: Estimate Std.

Values below 0 are fitted as 0, and values above 30 are fitted as 30. The model equation is physhealth = -11.00 + 0.49 bmi_c + 5.67 smoke100 18.17.2 Interpreting the Coefficients Tobit model regression coefficients are interpreted as we would a set of OLS coefficients, except that the linear effect is on the uncensored latent variable, rather than on the observed outcome. In our case, a one-unit increase in bmi_c is associated with a 0.49 day increase in the predicted value of physhealth, holding smoke100 constant a move from smoke100 = 0 to 1 is associated with a 5.67 day increase in the predicted value of physhealth, holding bmi_c constant the coefficient labeled (Intercept):1 is the intercept for the model and is the predicted value of physhealth when smoke100 = 0 and bmi_c = 0. Note that this value is -11, which is outside the range of physhealth values we observed. the coefficient labeled (Intercept):2 is a statistic we can use after we exponentiate it, as follows: here (Intercept):2 = 2.82, and exp(2.82) = 16.7768507, which is analogous to the square root of the residual variance in OLS regression, which is summarized for our OLS model as Residual standard error: 6.609. 18.17.3 Testing the Predictors We can test the model with and without bmi_c, for example, by fitting the model both ways, and comparing the results with either a Wald or Likelihood Ratio test, each of which is available in the lmtest package. mod_tob_nobmi &lt;- vglm(physhealth ~ smoke100, tobit(Lower = 0, Upper = 30), type.fitted = &quot;censored&quot;, data = sm_oh_A_young) lmtest::waldtest(mod_tob1, mod_tob_nobmi) Wald test Model 1: physhealth ~ bmi_c + smoke100 Model 2: physhealth ~ smoke100 Res.Df Df Chisq Pr(&gt;Chisq) 1 3264 2 3265 -1 45.386 1.618e-11 *** --- Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 The likelihood ratio test we have used in some other settings isn’t available here. 18.17.4 Store fitted values and residuals The residuals and fitted values from the tobit model can be stored and then summarized in several ways: sm_tob1 &lt;- sm_oh_A_young %&gt;% mutate(fitted = fitted(mod_tob1, type.fitted = &quot;censored&quot;), resid = physhealth - fitted) sm_tob1 %&gt;% dplyr::select(physhealth, fitted, resid) %&gt;% head() # A tibble: 6 x 3 physhealth fitted resid &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0 0. 0. 2 0 0. 0. 3 0 0. 0. 4 2 0. 2. 5 4 0. 4. 6 6 0. 6. 18.17.5 Building Something Like a Rootogram Building a rootogram is tricky for a tobit model, to say the least, but we can approximate a piece of the issue by plotting the rounded fitted values against the observed physhealth data. ggplot(sm_tob1, aes(x = physhealth, y = round(fitted))) + geom_jitter(width = 0.2) + geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1, col = &quot;red&quot;) Note that the model never predicts a subject to have an underlying physhealth worse than about 12 (remember that larger numbers are worse here.) 18.17.6 Tables of the Observed and Fitted physhealth from Tobit addmargins(table(round(sm_tob1$physhealth))) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 12 13 14 15 1109 93 112 52 24 43 5 32 1 1 19 3 1 25 26 16 17 18 20 21 24 25 26 27 28 30 Sum 1 1 1 8 6 1 1 1 1 1 66 1634 addmargins(table(round(sm_tob1$fitted))) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 10 11 13 Sum 1588 14 8 9 1 5 2 2 1 1 2 1 1634 18.17.7 Specify the R2 and log (likelihood) values We can calculate a proxy for R2 as the squared correlation of the fitted values and the observed values. # The correlation of observed and fitted values (tob1_r &lt;- with(sm_tob1, cor(physhealth, fitted))) [,1] [1,] 0.1440334 # R-square tob1_r^2 [,1] [1,] 0.02074562 logLik(mod_tob1) [1] -2563.135 Here, we have Model Scale R2 log(likelihood) Tobit physhealth .021 -2567.3 18.17.8 Check model assumptions Here is a plot of residuals vs. fitted values. ggplot(sm_tob1, aes(x = fitted, y = resid)) + geom_point() + labs(title = &quot;Residuals vs. Fitted Values for Tobit 1&quot;) Here is a normal Q-Q plot of the Tobit Model 1 residuals. qqnorm(sm_tob1$resid) 18.17.9 Predictions for Harry and Sally The predictions from this tobit model are obtained as follows… predict(mod_tob1, newdata = hs_data, type = &quot;response&quot;) [,1] 1 -0.4232846 2 -13.4852170 The prediction for both Harry and Sally under the tobit model would be truncated to 0 days.

To actually see what’s going on, we might build a comparison boxplot, or violin plot. The plot below shows both, together, with the violin plot helping to indicate the discrete nature of the sleephrs data and the boxplot indicating quartiles and outlying values within each genhealth category. ggplot(sm1, aes(x = genhealth, y = sleephrs)) + geom_violin(aes(fill = genhealth), trim = TRUE) + geom_boxplot(width = 0.2) + guides(fill = FALSE, color = FALSE) + theme_bw() 19.5.2 Describing the Proportional-Odds Cumulative Logit Model To fit the ordinal logistic regression model (specifically, a proportional-odds cumulative-logit model) in this situation, we’ll use the polr function in the MASS library. Our outcome is genh, which has five ordered levels, with 1-E best and 5-P worst. Our model will include one quantitative predictor, sleephrs. The model will have four logit equations: one estimating the log odds that genh will be less than or equal to 1 (i.e. genhealth = 1_Excellent,) one estimating the log odds that genh \\(\\leq\\) 2 (i.e. genhealth = 1_Excellent or 2_VeryGood,) another estimating the log odds that genh \\(\\leq\\) 3 (i.e. genhealth = 1_Excellent, 2_VeryGood or 3_Good,) and, finally, one estimating the log odds that genh \\(\\leq\\) 4 (i.e. genhealth = 1_Excellent, 2_VeryGood, 3_Good or 4_Fair) That’s all we need to estimate the five categories, since Pr(genh \\(\\leq\\) 5) = 1, because (5_Poor) is the maximum category for genhealth. We’ll have a total of five free parameters when we add in the slope for sleephrs, and I’ll label these parameters as \\(\\zeta_1, \\zeta_2, \\zeta_3, \\zeta_4\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\). The \\(\\zeta\\)s are read as “zeta” values, and the people who built the polr function use that term. The four logistic equations that will be fit differ only by their intercepts. They are: \\[ logit[Pr(genh \\leq 1)] = log \\frac{Pr(genh \\leq 1}{Pr(genh &gt; 1)} = \\zeta_1 - \\beta_1 sleephrs \\] which describes the log odds of a genh value of 1 (Excellent) as compared to a genh value greater than 1 (which includes Very Good, Good, Fair and Poor). The second logit model is: \\[ logit[Pr(genh \\leq 2)] = log \\frac{Pr(genh \\leq 2}{Pr(genh &gt; 2)} = \\zeta_2 - \\beta_1 sleephrs \\] which describes the log odds of a genh value of 1 (Excellent) or 2 (Very Good) as compared to a genh value greater than 2 (which includes Good, Fair and Poor). Next we have: \\[ logit[Pr(genh \\leq 3)] = log \\frac{Pr(genh \\leq 3}{Pr(genh &gt; 3)} = \\zeta_3 - \\beta_1 sleephrs \\] which describes the log odds of a genh value of 1 (Excellent) or 2 (Very Good) or 3 (Good) as compared to a genh value greater than 3 (which includes Fair and Poor). Finally, we have \\[ logit[Pr(genh \\leq 4)] = log \\frac{Pr(genh \\leq 4}{Pr(genh &gt; 4)} = \\zeta_4 - \\beta_1 sleephrs \\] which describes the log odds of a genh value of 4 or less, which includes Excellent, Very Good, Good and Fair as compared to a genh value greater than 4 (which is Poor). Again, the intercept term is the only piece that varies across the four equations. In this case, a positive coefficient \\(\\beta_1\\) for sleephrs means that increasing the value of sleephrs would increase the genh category (describing a worse level of general health, since higher values of genh are associated with worse health.) 19.5.3 Fitting a Proportional Odds Logistic Regression with polr Our model m1 will use proportional odds logistic regression (sometimes called an ordered logit model) to predict genh on the basis of sleephrs. The polr function can help us do this. Note that we include Hess = TRUE to retain what is called the Hessian matrix, which lets R calculate standard errors more effectively in summary and other follow-up descriptions of the model. m1 &lt;- polr(genh ~ sleephrs, data = sm1, Hess = TRUE) summary(m1) Call: polr(formula = genh ~ sleephrs, data = sm1, Hess = TRUE) Coefficients: Value Std.

We’re going to start by using our model m1 to predict the genh for Harry and Sally, so we can see the effect (on the predicted genh probabilities) of a change of one unit in sleephrs. For example, what are the log odds that Harry, who sleeps 6 hours, will describe his genh as Excellent (genh \\(\\leq\\) 1)? \\[ logit[Pr(genh \\leq 1)] = \\zeta_1 - \\beta_1 sleephrs \\\\ logit[Pr(genh \\leq 1)] = -2.5156 - (-0.1335) sleephrs \\\\ logit[Pr(genh \\leq 1)] = -2.5156 - (-0.1335) (6) = -1.7146 \\] That’s not much help. So we’ll convert it to a probability by taking the inverse logit. The formula is \\[ Pr(genh \\leq 1) = \\frac{exp(\\zeta_1 + \\beta_1 sleephrs)}{1 + exp(\\zeta_1 + \\beta_1 sleephrs)} = \\frac{exp(-1.7146)}{1 + exp(-1.7146)} = \\frac{0.180}{1.180} = 0.15 \\] So the model estimates a 15% probability that Harry will describe his genh as Excellent. OK. Now, what are the log odds that Harry, who sleeps 6 hours, will describe his genh as either Excellent or Very Good (genh \\(\\leq\\) 2)? \\[ logit[Pr(genh \\leq 2)] = \\zeta_2 - \\beta_1 sleephrs \\\\ logit[Pr(genh \\leq 2)] = -0.8823 - (-0.1335) sleephrs \\\\ logit[Pr(genh \\leq 2)] = -0.8823 - (-0.1335) (6) = -0.0813 \\] Again, we’ll convert this to a probability by taking the inverse logit. \\[ Pr(genh \\leq 2) = \\frac{exp(\\zeta_2 + \\beta_1 sleephrs)}{1 + exp(\\zeta_2 + \\beta_1 sleephrs)} = \\frac{exp(-0.0813)}{1 + exp(-0.0813)} = \\frac{0.922}{1.922} = 0.48 \\] So, the model estimates a probability of .48 that Harry will describe his genh as either Excellent or Very Good, so by subtraction, that’s a probability of .33 that Harry describes his genh as Very Good. Happily, that’s the last time we’ll calculate this by hand. 19.6.2 Making Predictions for Harry (and Sally) with predict Suppose Harry sleeps for 6 hours on average, and Sally for 5. temp.dat &lt;- data.frame(name = c(&quot;Harry&quot;, &quot;Sally&quot;), sleephrs = c(6,5)) predict(m1, temp.dat, type = &quot;p&quot;) 1-E 2_VG 3_G 4_F 5_P 1 0.1526268 0.3270672 0.3254990 0.1385938 0.05621333 2 0.1361555 0.3103702 0.3368797 0.1528675 0.06372711 The predicted probabilities of falling into each category of genh are: Subject sleephrs Pr(1_E) Pr(2_VG) Pr(3_G) Pr(4_F) Pr(5_P) Harry 6 15.3 32.7 32.6 13.9 5.6 Sally 5 13.6 31.0 33.7 15.3 6.4 Harry has a higher predicted probability of lower (healthier) values of genh. Specifically, Harry has a higher predicted probability than Sally of falling into the Excellent and Very Good categories, and a lower probability than Sally of falling into the Good, Fair and Poor categories. This means that Harry, with a higher sleephrs is predicted to have, on average, a lower (that is to say, healthier) value of genh. As we’ll see, this association will be indicated by a negative coefficient of sleephrs in the proportional odds logistic regression model. 19.6.3 Predicting the actual classification of genh The default prediction approach actually returns the predicted genh classification for Harry and Sally, which is just the classification with the largest predicted probability. Here, for Harry that is Very Good, and for Sally, that’s Good. predict(m1, temp.dat) [1] 2_VG 3_G Levels: 1-E 2_VG 3_G 4_F 5_P 19.6.4 A Cross-Tabuation of Predictions? addmargins(table(predict(m1), sm1$genh)) 1-E 2_VG 3_G 4_F 5_P Sum 1-E 2 0 3 1 2 8 2_VG 750 1493 1278 471 155 4147 3_G 55 113 187 126 83 564 4_F 0 0 0 0 0 0 5_P 0 0 0 0 0 0 Sum 807 1606 1468 598 240 4719 The m1 model classifies all subjects in the sm1 sample as either Excellent, Very Good or Good, and most subjects as Very Good. 19.6.5 The Fitted Model Equations summary(m1) Call: polr(formula = genh ~ sleephrs, data = sm1, Hess = TRUE) Coefficients: Value Std.

Plugging in the estimates, we have: \\[ logit[Pr(genh \\leq 1)] = -2.5156 - (-0.1335) sleephrs \\\\ logit[Pr(genh \\leq 2)] = -0.8823 - (-0.1335) sleephrs \\\\ logit[Pr(genh \\leq 3)] = 0.6186 - (-0.1335) sleephrs \\\\ logit[Pr(genh \\leq 4)] = 2.0202 - (-0.1335) sleephrs \\] Note that we can obtain these pieces separately as follows: m1$zeta 1-E|2_VG 2_VG|3_G 3_G|4_F 4_F|5_P -2.5148414 -0.8819647 0.6183763 2.0200504 shows the boundary intercepts, and m1$coefficients sleephrs -0.1334493 shows the regression coefficient for sleephrs. 19.6.6 Interpreting the sleephrs coefficient The first part of the output provides coefficient estimates for the sleephrs predictor. The estimated slope for sleephrs is -0.133 Remember Harry and Sally, who have the same values of bmi and costprob, but Harry gets one more hour of sleep than Sally does. We noted that Harry is predicted by the model to have a smaller (i.e. healthier) genh response than Sally. So a negative coefficient here means that higher values of sleephrs are associated with more of the probability distribution falling in lower values of genh. We usually don’t interpret this slope (on the log odds scale) directly, but rather exponentiate it. 19.6.7 Exponentiating the Slope Coefficient to facilitate Interpretation We can compute the odds ratio associated with sleephrs and its confidence interval as follows… exp(coef(m1)) sleephrs 0.8750718 exp(confint(m1)) Waiting for profiling to be done... 2.5 % 97.5 % 0.8420676 0.9092032 So, if Harry gets one more hour of sleep than Sally, our model predicts that Harry will have 88% of the odds of Sally of having a larger genh score. That means that Harry is likelier to have a smaller genh score. Since genh gets larger as a person’s general health gets worse (moves from Excellent towards Poor), this means that since Harry is predicted to have smaller odds of a larger genh score, he is also predicted to have smaller odds of worse general health. Our 95% confidence interval around that estimated odds ratio of 0.875 is (0.842, 0.909). Since that interval is entirely below 1, the odds of having the larger (worse) genh for Harry are statistically significantly lower than the odds for Sally. So, an increase in sleephrs is associated with smaller (better) genh scores. 19.6.8 Comparison to a Null Model We can fit a model with intercepts only to test the significance of sleephrs in our model m1, using the anova function. m0 &lt;- polr(genh ~ 1, data = sm1) anova(m1, m0) Likelihood ratio tests of ordinal regression models Response: genh Model Resid. df Resid.

First, we’ll get the probabilities, in another way, to demonstrate how to do so… (prob.6 &lt;- exp(m1$zeta - 6*m1$coefficients)/(1 + exp(m1$zeta - 6*m1$coefficients))) 1-E|2_VG 2_VG|3_G 3_G|4_F 4_F|5_P 0.1526268 0.4796939 0.8051929 0.9437867 (prob.5 &lt;- exp(m1$zeta - 5*m1$coefficients)/(1 + exp(m1$zeta - 5*m1$coefficients))) 1-E|2_VG 2_VG|3_G 3_G|4_F 4_F|5_P 0.1361555 0.4465257 0.7834054 0.9362729 Now, we’ll calculate the odds, first for a subject getting six hours of sleep: (odds.6 = prob.6/(1-prob.6)) 1-E|2_VG 2_VG|3_G 3_G|4_F 4_F|5_P 0.1801175 0.9219457 4.1332835 16.7893748 And here are the odds, for a subject getting five hours of sleep: (odds.5 = prob.5/(1-prob.5)) 1-E|2_VG 2_VG|3_G 3_G|4_F 4_F|5_P 0.1576158 0.8067687 3.6169200 14.6919090 Now, let’s take the ratio of the odds for someone who sleeps 6 hours over the odds for someone who sleeps 5. odds.6/odds.5 1-E|2_VG 2_VG|3_G 3_G|4_F 4_F|5_P 1.142763 1.142763 1.142763 1.142763 They are all the same. The odds ratios are equal, which means they are proportional. For any level of genh, the estimated odds that a person who sleeps 6 hours has better (lower) genh is about 1.14 times the odds for someone who sleeps 5 hours. Those who sleep more have higher odds of better (lower) genh. Less than 1 means lower odds, and more than 1 means greater odds. Now, let’s take the log of the odds ratios: log(odds.6/odds.5) 1-E|2_VG 2_VG|3_G 3_G|4_F 4_F|5_P 0.1334493 0.1334493 0.1334493 0.1334493 That should be familiar. It is the slope coefficient in the model summary, without the minus sign. R tacks on a minus sign so that higher levels of predictors correspond to the ordinal outcome falling in the higher end of its scale. If we exponentiate the slope estimated by R (-0.128), we get 0.88. If we have two people, and A sleeps one more hour on average than B, then the estimated odds of A having a higher ‘genh’ (i.e. worse general health) are 88% as higher as B’s. 19.7.1 Testing the Proportional Odds Assumption One way to test the proportional odds assumption is to compare the fit of the proportional odds logistic regression to a model that does not make that assumption. A natural candidate is a multinomial logit model, which is typically used to model unordered multi-categorical outcomes, and fits a slope to each level of the genh outcome in this case, as opposed to the proportional odds logit, which fits only one slope across all levels. Since the proportional odds logistic regression model is nested in the multinomial logit, we can perform a likelihood ratio test. To do this, we first fit the multinomial logit model, with the multinom function from the nnet package. (m1_multi &lt;- multinom(genh ~ sleephrs, data = sm1)) # weights: 15 (8 variable) initial value 7594.937509 iter 10 value 6800.789221 final value 6794.943171 converged Call: multinom(formula = genh ~ sleephrs, data = sm1) Coefficients: (Intercept) sleephrs 2_VG 0.6974561 -0.001316394 3_G 1.0935031 -0.070984363 4_F 1.0634375 -0.199129778 5_P 0.2109232 -0.208238458 Residual Deviance: 13589.89 AIC: 13605.89 The multinomial logit fits four intercepts and four slopes, for a total of 8 estimated parameters. The proportional odds logit, as we’ve seen, fits four intercepts and one slope, for a total of 5. The difference is 3, and we use that number in the sequence below to build our test of the proportional odds assumption. LL_1 &lt;- logLik(m1) LL_1m &lt;- logLik(m1_multi) (G &lt;- -2 * (LL_1[1] - LL_1m[1])) [1] 4.125118 pchisq(G, 3, lower.tail = FALSE) [1] 0.2482667 The p value is fairly large, so it indicates that the proportional odds model fits about as well as the more complex multinomial logit. A non-significant p value here isn’t always the best way to assess the proportional odds assumption, but it does provide some evidence of model adequacy. 19.8 Can model m1 be fit using rms tools?

Since these values are all below 1, we have a clear indication of a significant effect of sleephrs with higher sleephrs associated with lower genh, which means, in this case, better health. There is also a tool in rms called orm which may be used to fit a wide array of ordinal regression models. I suggest you read Frank Harrell’s book on Regression Modeling Strategies if you want to learn more. 19.9 Building a Three-Predictor Model Now, we’ll model genh using sleephrs, bmi and costprob. 19.9.1 Scatterplot Matrix GGally::ggpairs(sm1 %&gt;% select(bmi, sleephrs, costprob, genh)) `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`. `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`. `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`. We might choose to plot the costprob data as a binary factor, rather than the raw 0-1 numbers included above, but not at this time. 19.9.2 Our Three-Predictor Model, m2 m2 &lt;- polr(genh ~ sleephrs + bmi + costprob, data = sm1) summary(m2) Re-fitting to get Hessian Call: polr(formula = genh ~ sleephrs + bmi + costprob, data = sm1) Coefficients: Value Std.

Increasing bmi by 1 kg/m2 is associated with increasing the odds (by a factor of 1.08 with 95% CI 1.07, 1.09)) of higher values of genh: hence increasing bmi is associated with reducing the odds of a response indicating better health. Increasing costprob from 0 to 1 is associated with an increase (by a factor of 2.17 with 95% CI 1.80, 2.62)) of a higher genh value. Since higher genh values indicate worse health, those with costprob = 1 are modeled to have generally worse health. exp(coef(m2)) sleephrs bmi costprob 0.9007276 1.0837784 2.1832652 exp(confint(m2)) Waiting for profiling to be done...

Meanwhile, the data set and analysis are based on the work of Peng RD and Hengartner NW (2002) Quantitative analysis of literary styles, The American Statistician, 56, 175-185. The authorship.csv data file contains 841 rows. Each row describes a block of text that contains 1700 total words from one of several books by four authors: Jane Austen (samples from 7 books), Jack London (6 books), John Milton (2 books), or William Shakespeare (12 books). The data include counts within the blocks of text of 69 function words, such as “a”, “by”, “no”, “that” and “with”. The goal of our analysis, mirroring that of Simonoff, will be to use the incidence of these function words to build a model that distinguishes the authors. authorship$Author &lt;- factor(authorship$Author, levels = c(&quot;Shakespeare&quot;, &quot;Austen&quot;, &quot;London&quot;, &quot;Milton&quot;)) authorship # A tibble: 841 x 71 BookID Author a all also an and any are as at &lt;int&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; 1 1 Austen 46 12 0 3 66 9 4 16 13 2 1 Austen 35 10 0 7 44 4 3 18 16 3 1 Austen 46 2 0 3 40 1 13 11 9 4 1 Austen 40 7 0 4 64 3 3 20 13 5 1 Austen 29 5 0 6 52 5 14 17 6 6 1 Austen 27 8 0 3 42 2 15 11 14 7 1 Austen 34 8 0 15 44 2 6 16 14 8 1 Austen 38 6 1 2 67 3 6 17 4 9 1 Austen 34 12 0 5 50 2 8 7 13 10 1 Austen 54 8 0 6 44 4 8 13 17 # ... with 831 more rows, and 60 more variables: be &lt;int&gt;, been &lt;int&gt;, # but &lt;int&gt;, by &lt;int&gt;, can &lt;int&gt;, do &lt;int&gt;, down &lt;int&gt;, even &lt;int&gt;, # every &lt;int&gt;, `for` &lt;int&gt;, from &lt;int&gt;, had &lt;int&gt;, has &lt;int&gt;, # have &lt;int&gt;, her &lt;int&gt;, his &lt;int&gt;, `if` &lt;int&gt;, `in` &lt;int&gt;, into &lt;int&gt;, # is &lt;int&gt;, it &lt;int&gt;, its &lt;int&gt;, may &lt;int&gt;, more &lt;int&gt;, must &lt;int&gt;, # my &lt;int&gt;, no &lt;int&gt;, not &lt;int&gt;, now &lt;int&gt;, of &lt;int&gt;, on &lt;int&gt;, # one &lt;int&gt;, only &lt;int&gt;, or &lt;int&gt;, our &lt;int&gt;, should &lt;int&gt;, so &lt;int&gt;, # some &lt;int&gt;, such &lt;int&gt;, than &lt;int&gt;, that &lt;int&gt;, the &lt;int&gt;, # their &lt;int&gt;, then &lt;int&gt;, there &lt;int&gt;, things &lt;int&gt;, this &lt;int&gt;, # to &lt;int&gt;, up &lt;int&gt;, upon &lt;int&gt;, was &lt;int&gt;, were &lt;int&gt;, what &lt;int&gt;, # when &lt;int&gt;, which &lt;int&gt;, who &lt;int&gt;, will &lt;int&gt;, with &lt;int&gt;, # would &lt;int&gt;, your &lt;int&gt; To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow, Creeps in this petty pace from day to day, To the last syllable of recorded time; And all our yesterdays have lighted fools The way to dusty death.

Almost 98% of the blocks of text are correctly classified. Fly, envious Time, till thou run out thy race; Call on the lazy leaden-stepping hours, Whose speed is but the heavy plummet’s pace; And glut thyself with what thy womb devours, Which is no more then what is false and vain, And merely mortal dross; So little is our loss, So little is thy gain. For when, as each thing bad thou hast entomb’d And last of all thy greedy self consumed, Then long Eternity shall greet our bliss, With an individual kiss; And Joy shall overtake us, as a flood, When every thing that is sincerely good, And perfectly divine, With truth, and peace, and love, shall ever shine, About the supreme throne Of Him, to whose happy-making sight, alone, When once our heavenly-guided soul shall climb, Then all this earthly grossness quit, Attired with stars, we shall for ever sit, Triumphing over Death, and Chance, and thee, O Time! 20.6 Probability Curves based on a Single Predictor In situations where only one predictor is used, we can develop nice plots of estimated probabilities for each group as a function of the predictor. Suppose we look at the single word “been” (note that this was left out of Model 2.)

In a randomized controlled trial of cancer, for instance, surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy might be compared with respect to time from randomization and the start of therapy until death. In this case, the event of interest is the death of a patient, but in other situations it might be remission from a disease, relief from symptoms or the recurrence of a particular condition. Such observations are generally referred to by the generic term survival data even when the endpoint or event being considered is not death but something else. These notes on survival analysis are just an introduction to the key ideas of the field. The PQHS department offers an entire course on survival analysis (PQHS 435) and I recommend that to those of you interested in deeper learning about the approaches we’ll discuss, or in learning more about other approaches to survival analysis. The OpenIntro Statistics extra material on Survival Analysis in R, written by David Diez is a very useful guide to survival analysis in R, using the survival package and supplemented by the KMsurv and OIsurv packages. A PDF version of that material is available, along with a full set of the code used in that guide. 21.1 An Outline of Key Topics Discussed in these Notes In this chapter, we tackle the building blocks of survival analysis, and use R to work with survival objects. The Survival Function, \\(S(t)\\) The Kaplan-Meier Estimate/Plot Comparing Survival Functions with log rank test The Hazard Function, \\(H(t) = -log(S(t))\\) Using survival and related packages in R In the next chapter, we introduce the the Cox Proportional Hazards Regression Model, one of several available models for fitting regressions to time-to-event (survival) outcomes. 21.2 Foundations of Survival Analysis Survival analysis is concerned with prospective studies, where we start with a cohort of subjects and follow them forwards in time to determine some clinical outcome. Follow-up continues until either some event of interest occurs, the study ends, or further observation becomes impossible. The outcomes in a survival analysis consist of the subject’s fate and length of follow-up at the end of the study. For some patients, the outcome of interest may not occur during follow-up. For such patients, whose follow-up time is censored, we know only that this event did not occur while the patient was being followed. We do not know whether or not it will occur at some later time. The primary problems with survival data are non-normality and censoring… Survival data are quantitative, but not symmetrically distributed. They will often appear positively skewed, with a few people surviving a very long time compared with the majority; so assuming a normal distribution will not be reasonable. At the completion of the study, some patients may not have reached the endpoint of interest (death, relapse, etc.). Consequently, the exact survival times are not known. All that is known is that the survival times are greater than the amount of time the individual has been in the study. The survival times of these individuals are said to be censored (precisely, they are right-censored). 21.2.1 The Survival Function, \\(S(t)\\) The survival function, \\(S(t)\\) (sometimes called the survivor function) is the probability that the survival time, \\(T\\), is greater than or equal to a particular time, \\(t\\). \\(S(t)\\) = proportion of people surviving to time \\(t\\) or beyond If there’s no censoring, the survival function is easy to estimate. \\[ \\hat{S}(t) = \\frac{\\# \\mbox{ of subjects with survival times } \\geq t}{n} \\] but this won’t work if there is censoring. 21.2.2 Kaplan-Meier Estimator of the Survival Function The survival function \\(S(t)\\) is the probability of surviving until at least time \\(t\\). It is essentially estimated by the number of patients alive at time \\(t\\) divided by the total number of study subjects remaining at that time. The Kaplan-Meier estimator first orders the (unique) survival times from smallest to largest, then estimates the survival function at each unique survival time. The survival function at the second death time, \\(t_{(2)}\\) is equal to the estimated probability of not dying at time \\(t_{(2)}\\) conditional on the individual being still at risk at time \\(t_{(2)}\\). In the presence of censoring, the survival function is estimated as follows. Order the survival times from smallest to largest, where t_{(j)} is the \\(j\\)th largest unique survival time, so we have… \\[ t_{(1)} \\leq t_{(2)} \\leq t_{(3)} \\leq ... t_{(n)} \\] The Kaplan-Meier estimate of the survival function is \\[ \\hat{S}(t) = \\prod_{j: t_{(j)} \\leq t} (1 - \\frac{d_j}{r_j}) \\] where \\(r_j\\) is the number of people at risk just before \\(t_{(j)}\\), including those censored at time \\(t_{(j)}\\), and \\(d_j\\) is the number of people who experience the event at time \\(t_{(j)}\\). When we want to compare survival functions (or their Kaplan-Meier estimates, at least) we’ll use a log rank test or one of several extensions of that test. 21.2.3 Creating a Survival Object in R To do survival analysis in R, we’re going to start with three main functions, all in the survival package: Surv creates a survival object survfit builds a Kaplan-Meier test, and the results may be plotted, as we’ve seen. survdiff builds a log rank test, that will let us compare two survival functions, as well as running several alternatives. Plus, we’ll build out some estimates of the hazard function. The Surv function, part of the survival package in R, will create a survival object from two arguments: time = follow-up time event = a status indicator, where event = 1 or TRUE means the event was observed (for instance, the patient died) event = 0 or FALSE means the follow-up time was censored 21.3 A First Example: Recurrent Lobar Intracerebral Hemorrhage O’Donnell et al. (2000) studied the effect of the apolipoprotein E gene on the risk of recurrent lobar intracerebral hemorrhage in 70 patients who survived such a hemorrhage21. Patients in the study are classified by: time = follow-up time, in months recur = indicator of whether or not they had a recurrent event (1 = subject had a recurrence, 0 subject did not have a recurrence), and genotype = the subject’s apolipoprotein E genotype (0 = Homozygous \\(\\epsilon3/\\epsilon3\\) and 1 = At least one \\(\\epsilon2\\) or \\(\\epsilon4\\) allele) hem %&gt;% head(.,4) # A tibble: 4 x 4 id genotype time recur &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; 1 1 0 0.230 1 2 2 0 1.05 0 3 3 1 1.38 0 4 4 1 1.41 1 table(hem$recur) 0 1 52 18 We have 70 patients at the start, and observe 18 events (rest are censored.) hem %&gt;% group_by(recur) %&gt;% skim(time) Skim summary statistics n obs: 70 n variables: 4 group variables: recur Variable type: numeric recur variable missing complete n mean sd p0 p25 median p75 0 time 0 52 52 25.51 14.68 1.05 14.41 23.01 38.64 1 time 0 18 18 14.99 13.89 0.23 3.37 10.92 24.85 p100 53.88 42.87 The median survival time looks like 23 weeks in the patients who do not exhibit a recurrence, but only 11 weeks in those who do. 21.3.1 Building a Survival Object hemsurv &lt;- Surv(time = hem$time, event = hem$recur) head(hemsurv, 4) [1] 0.2299795 1.0513350+ 1.3798770+ 1.4127311 This object both displays the survival time for each subject, and indicates whether or not the subject’s follow-up was censored before a recurrent event occurred. Survival times with a + sign indicate censoring. Subject 1 lived for 0.23 months hemorrhage-free and then had a recurrence. Subject 2 lived for 1.05 months hemorrhage-free, at which point they were censored (perhaps because the study ended, or perhaps because the subject was no longer available for follow-up) Remember that 18 of the subjects experienced a recurrent hemorrhage, and the other 52 are therefore censored. 21.3.2 Kaplan-Meier Estimate of the Survival Function To build a Kaplan-Meier estimate of the survival function (to account properly for censoring), we take the survival object we have created, and use the survfit function from the survival package. hemfit1 &lt;- survfit(hemsurv ~ 1) We can look at the hemfit1 object directly, although the K-M estimate is usually plotted. print(hemfit1, print.rmean=TRUE) Call: survfit(formula = hemsurv ~ 1) n events *rmean *se(rmean) median 0.95LCL 70.00 18.00 40.37 2.63 NA 42.87 0.95UCL NA * restricted mean with upper limit = 53.9 We see that 18 events occurred out of a total of 70 subjects. The median survival time is listed as NA (missing) which implies it cannot be estimated by this simple model. This is because only 18 of our 70 subjects have a known recurrence-free survival time (the rest are censored), so we don’t actually know what the median survival time will be across our 70 subjects. Apparently, R can produce a lower bound on a 95% confidence interval for the median survival time, but not the actual point estimate. We also observe a restricted mean survival time estimate. The restricted mean uses as its upper limit the largest observed or censored survival time, which here is a censored value: 53.9 months. So it is the mean survival time, assuming all censored subjects lived hemorrhage-free for 53.9 months. summary(hemfit1) Call: survfit(formula = hemsurv ~ 1) time n.risk n.event survival std.err lower 95% CI upper 95% CI 0.23 70 1 0.986 0.0142 0.958 1.000 1.41 67 1 0.971 0.0202 0.932 1.000 1.58 65 1 0.956 0.0248 0.909 1.000 3.06 63 1 0.941 0.0287 0.886 0.999 3.32 62 1 0.926 0.0320 0.865 0.991 3.52 61 1 0.911 0.0349 0.845 0.982 3.55 60 1 0.895 0.0375 0.825 0.972 4.76 57 1 0.880 0.0400 0.805 0.962 9.53 54 1 0.863 0.0424 0.784 0.951 12.32 50 1 0.846 0.0449 0.762 0.939 15.57 46 1 0.828 0.0476 0.740 0.926 19.15 38 1 0.806 0.0511 0.712 0.912 24.77 32 1 0.781 0.0553 0.679 0.897 24.87 31 1 0.756 0.0590 0.648 0.881 28.09 26 1 0.726 0.0635 0.612 0.862 33.61 22 1 0.693 0.0687 0.571 0.842 37.52 17 1 0.653 0.0758 0.520 0.819 42.87 8 1 0.571 0.1011 0.404 0.808 This written summary provides us with lots of detail on the Kaplan-Meier estimate. In particular, the first two lines of this summary can be read to indicate the following. Up to time 0.23 months, no patients had a recurrence. Then, an event occurred, and the estimated survival (i.e. non-recurrence) probability is reduced from 1 to 0.986. By time 1.41 months, when the next event occurred, only 67 patients remained at risk. This is because one of them had a recurrent hemorrhage already (at 0.23 months) and two others had been right-censored. The estimated hemorrhage-free survival probability estimate starting at time 1.41 months is now 0.971. A Kaplan-Meier plot graphically represents this summary. 21.3.3 The Kaplan-Meier Plot, using Base R Now, let’s plot the Kaplan-Meier estimate, so we can see what is going on. plot(hemfit1, ylab=&quot;Pr(Hemorrhage-Free Survival)&quot;, xlab=&quot;Months of Follow-Up&quot;, main=&quot;Kaplan-Meier Plot for hem Data&quot;) The solid line indicates estimated hemorrhage-free survival probability. The dotted lines identify pointwise confidence intervals (default 95%). For example, we see that the estimated probability of hemorrhage-free survival to 20 months is estimated to be about 0.8 The estimated probability of hemorrhage-free survival to 50 months is estimated to be about 0.6 The steps down indicate events (recurrences.) The estimated probability of survival to 0 months starts at 1, and drops down at each time point where an event (or more than one event) is observed. 21.3.4 Using survminer to draw survival curves Another approach to plotting the Kaplan-Meier estimate comes from ggsurvplot, from the survminer package. ggsurvplot(hemfit1, data = hem) Again, the solid line indicates estimated hemorrhage-free survival probability. The crosses indicate censoring. The steps down indicate events (recurrences,) and the shading indicates (default 95%) pointwise confidence intervals. By pointwise confidence intervals, I mean that these bounds apply only to individual points in the time scale. For more on an alternative approach, using simultaneous confidence bands, visit the OpenIntro Statistics Survival Analysis in R materials, written by David Diez, which are also posted on our web site. 21.3.5 A “Fancy” K-M Plot with a number at risk table We can do a lot more with these plots. Following the suggestions at https://github.com/kassambara/survminer/ we can create the following… ggsurvplot(hemfit1, data = hem, conf.int = TRUE, # Add confidence interval risk.table = TRUE, # Add risk table xlab = &quot;Time in months&quot;, # adjust X axis label break.time.by = 12 # add tick every 12 months ) This sort of plot is really designed to work best when we compare multiple groups in terms of their survival. So let’s do that. 21.4 Comparing Survival Across the Two Genotypes Now, suppose we want to compare the hemorrhage-free survival functions for subjects classified by their apoliprotein E genotype. Working with the same survival object hemsurv we now run the survfit function to compare across the two genotype groups. hemfit2 &lt;- survfit(hemsurv ~ hem$genotype) print(hemfit2, print.rmean=TRUE) Call: survfit(formula = hemsurv ~ hem$genotype) n events *rmean *se(rmean) median 0.95LCL 0.95UCL hem$genotype=0 32 4 44.8 2.64 NA NA NA hem$genotype=1 38 14 32.7 3.43 37.5 24.9 NA * restricted mean with upper limit = 50.4 In genotype = 0 (the subjects who are Homozygous \\(\\epsilon3/\\epsilon3\\),) we had 32 subjects, and observed 4 recurrent hemorrhages. Our estimated restricted mean survival time in those subjects is 44.8 months and we cannot estimate a median survival time because only a small fraction of our subjects were not censored. In genotype = 1 (subjects who have at least one \\(\\epsilon2\\) or \\(\\epsilon4\\) allele,) we had 38 subjects and observed 14 recurrences. The estimated restricted mean survival time is 32.7 months in these subjects, and we can (it seems) estimate a median survival time in this group of 37.5 months. Note that we don’t actually need to observe the event in half of the subjects to estimate a median survival time. 21.4.1 Kaplan-Meier Survival Function Estimates, by Genotype I find I have to crank the fig.height in Markdown up to at least 6 to get the risk table to show up nicely in this setting. ggsurvplot(hemfit2, data = hem, conf.int = TRUE, xlab = &quot;Time in months&quot;, break.time.by = 12, legend.labs = c(&quot;Homozygous&quot;, &quot;Heterozygous&quot;), risk.table = TRUE, risk.table.height = 0.25 ) It appears that patients who were homozygous for the \\(\\epsilon3\\) allele of this gene (i.e. genotype = 0 in the hemorrhage data) had a much better prognosis than others (genotype = 1.) 21.5 Testing the difference between two survival curves To obtain a significance test comparing these two survival curves, we turn to a log rank test, which tests the null hypothesis \\(H_0: S_1(t) = S_2(t)\\) for all \\(t\\) where the two exposures have survival functions \\(S_1(t)\\) and \\(S_2(t)\\). We use the survdiff function to explore this test, which uses a \\(\\chi^2\\) statistic to do the testing. survdiff(hemsurv ~ hem$genotype) Call: survdiff(formula = hemsurv ~ hem$genotype) N Observed Expected (O-E)^2/E (O-E)^2/V hem$genotype=0 32 4 9.28 3.00 6.28 hem$genotype=1 38 14 8.72 3.19 6.28 Chisq= 6.3 on 1 degrees of freedom, p= 0.0122 Based on the log rank test, we conclude that there is a statistically significant difference (\\(p\\) = .0122) between the hemorrhage-free survival curves for the two genotypes, as shown in the Kaplan-Meier plot. The log rank test generalizes to permit survival comparisons across more than two groups, with the test statistic having an asymptotic chi-squared distribution with one degree of freedom less than the number of patient groups being compared. 21.5.1 Alternative log rank tests An alternative approach to testing is the Peto and Peto modification of the Gehan-Wilcoxon test, which results from adding rho=1 to the survdiff function (rho=0, the default, yields the log rank test.) survdiff(hemsurv ~ hem$genotype, rho=1) Call: survdiff(formula = hemsurv ~ hem$genotype, rho = 1) N Observed Expected (O-E)^2/E (O-E)^2/V hem$genotype=0 32 3.63 7.87 2.29 5.46 hem$genotype=1 38 11.79 7.54 2.39 5.46 Chisq= 5.5 on 1 degrees of freedom, p= 0.0194 As compared to the log rank test, this Peto-Peto modification (and others using rho &gt; 0) give greater weight to the left hand (earlier) side of the survival curves. To obtain chi-square tests that give greater weight to the right hand (later) side of the survival curves than the log rank test, use a rho value which is less than 0. 21.6 A “Fancy” K-M Plot with a number at risk table We can add the log rank test result to our “fancy” K-M plot. Visit https://github.com/kassambara/survminer/ for more options. ggsurvplot(hemfit2, data = hem, size = 1, palette = c(&quot;purple&quot;, &quot;darkgoldenrod&quot;), # custom colors conf.int = TRUE, # Add confidence interval pval = TRUE, # Add p-value risk.table = TRUE, # Add risk table risk.table.height = 0.25, # change if you have &gt;2 groups risk.table.y.text.col = T, # show colors in table listing xlab = &quot;Time in months&quot;, # adjust X axis label break.time.by = 12, # break X axis in time intervals legend.labs = c(&quot;Homozygous&quot;, &quot;Heterozygous&quot;), # labels ggtheme = theme_bw() # Change ggplot2 theme ) 21.6.1 Customizing the Kaplan-Meier Plot Presentation Further We can even add a plot of the number of censored subjects at each time point, as well as a median survival pointer (which, of course, we’ve seen that we can’t estimate in one of the groups), and customize the style of the confidence intervals. Again, see https://github.com/kassambara/survminer/ for even more customized results. ggsurvplot(hemfit2, data = hem, palette = c(&quot;#E7B800&quot;, &quot;#2E9FDF&quot;), risk.table = TRUE, pval = TRUE, conf.int = TRUE, xlab = &quot;Time in months&quot;, break.time.by = 12, ggtheme = theme_light(), risk.table.y.text.col = T, risk.table.height = 0.25, risk.table.y.text = FALSE, ncensor.plot = TRUE, ncensor.plot.height = 0.25, conf.int.style = &quot;step&quot;, surv.median.line = &quot;hv&quot;, legend.labs = c(&quot;Homozygous&quot;, &quot;Heterozygous&quot;) ) 21.7 The Hazard Function To build regression models for time-to-event data, we will need to introduce the hazard function. Consider a subject in the hemorrhage study who has a hemorrhage-free survival time of 9 months. For this subject to have had a recurrent hemorrhage at 9 months, they had to be hemorrhage-free for the first 8 months. The subject’s hazard at 9 months is the failure rate “per month” conditional on the subject being hemorrhage-free for the first 8 months. If \\(S(t)\\) is the survival function, and time \\(t\\) is taken to be continuous, then \\(S(t) = e^{H(t)}\\) defines the hazard function \\(H(t)\\). Note that \\(H(t)\\) = \\(-ln(S(t))\\). The function \\(H(t)\\) is an important analytic tool. It’s used to describe the concept of the risk of “failure” in an interval after time \\(t\\), conditioned on the subject having survived to time \\(t\\). It’s often called the cumulative hazard function, to emphasize the fact that its value is the “sum” of the hazard up to time \\(t\\). There are several different methods to estimate \\(H(t)\\), but we’ll focus on two… The inverse Kaplan-Meier estimator The Nelson-Aalen estimator 21.7.1 The Inverse Kaplan-Meier Estimator of \\(H(t)\\) Our first estimator of the hazard function, \\(H(t)\\) will be the inverse Kaplan-Meier estimate, which I’ll place in an R object called H_est1. To start, we will take the negative of the log of the Kaplan-Meier survival estimate. That takes care of the first t-1 levels of the eventual estimate. To complete the process, we will repeat the final one of those time-specific estimates at the end. # hemsurv &lt;- Surv(hem$time, hem$recur) # hemfit1 &lt;- survfit(hemsurv ~ 1) H_est1 &lt;- -log(hemfit1$surv) H_est1 &lt;- c(H_est1, tail(H_est1, 1)) Here are the first five, and last five values of the hazard function estimate. head(H_est1,5) # first 5 values [1] 0.01438874 0.01438874 0.01438874 0.02942661 0.02942661 tail(H_est1, 5) # last 5 [1] 0.5602049 0.5602049 0.5602049 0.5602049 0.5602049 We can create a little data frame containing the times and hazard estimates, like this: haz_hem &lt;- data_frame( time = c(hemfit1$time, tail(hemfit1$time, 1)), inverse_KM = H_est1 ) 21.7.2 Cumulative Hazard Function from Inverse K-M Since we’ve built the data set of times and hazard values, we can use the geom_step function in ggplot2. ggplot(haz_hem, aes(x = time, y = inverse_KM)) + geom_step() + scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0, 12, 24, 36, 48)) + labs(x = &quot;Months of Follow-Up&quot;, y = &quot;Cumulative Hazard&quot;, title = &quot;Cumulative Hazard Function via Inverse K-M&quot;) 21.7.3 The Nelson-Aalen Estimator of \\(H(t)\\) An alternative estimate of the cumulative hazard is called the Nelson-Aalen estimate, captured here in H_est2. h_st &lt;- hemfit1$n.event / hemfit1$n.risk H_est2 &lt;- cumsum(h_st) H_est2 &lt;- c(H_est2, tail(H_est2, 1)) haz_hem$Nelson_Aalen &lt;- H_est2 head(haz_hem) # A tibble: 6 x 3 time inverse_KM Nelson_Aalen &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0.230 0.0144 0.0143 2 1.05 0.0144 0.0143 3 1.38 0.0144 0.0143 4 1.41 0.0294 0.0292 5 1.51 0.0294 0.0292 6 1.58 0.0449 0.0446 21.7.4 Convert Wide Data to Long In order to easily plot the two hazard function estimates in the same graph, we’ll want to convert these data from wide format to long format, with the gather function. haz_hem_comp &lt;- gather(haz_hem, key = &quot;method&quot;, value = &quot;hazardest&quot;, inverse_KM:Nelson_Aalen) head(haz_hem_comp) # A tibble: 6 x 3 time method hazardest &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0.230 inverse_KM 0.0144 2 1.05 inverse_KM 0.0144 3 1.38 inverse_KM 0.0144 4 1.41 inverse_KM 0.0294 5 1.51 inverse_KM 0.0294 6 1.58 inverse_KM 0.0449 21.7.5 Plot Comparison of Hazard Estimates ggplot(haz_hem_comp, aes(x = time, y = hazardest, col = method)) + geom_step(size = 2) + scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0, 12, 24, 36, 48)) + labs(x = &quot;Months of Follow-Up&quot;, y = &quot;Cumulative Hazard&quot;, title = &quot;Cumulative Hazard Function&quot;) + theme_bw() We can see that the two cumulative hazard function estimates are nearly identical in this case. We could instead compare the two functions in faceted plots, if that would be helpful. ggplot(haz_hem_comp, aes(x = time, y = hazardest)) + geom_step() + scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0, 12, 24, 36, 48)) + labs(x = &quot;Months of Follow-Up&quot;, y = &quot;Cumulative Hazard&quot;, title = &quot;Cumulative Hazard Function&quot;) + facet_grid(method ~ .) + theme_bw() Next, we will consider the issue of modeling a survival outcome using Cox proportional hazards regression.

For particular \\(x\\) values, we will be able to estimate the survival function if we have an estimate of the baseline survival function, \\(\\hat{S_0}(t)\\). The estimated survival function for an individual with covariate value \\(x_k\\) turns out to be \\[ \\hat{S}(t | x_k) = [\\hat{S_0}(t)]^{exp(\\beta_1 x_k)} \\] From Wikipedia (yes, really) … Survival models can be viewed as consisting of two parts: the underlying hazard function, describing how the risk of event per time unit changes over time at baseline levels of covariates; and the effect parameters, describing how the hazard varies in response to explanatory covariates. The key assumption in a Cox model is that the hazards are proportional - other types of survival models need not have this restriction. Quoting the always reliable (well, it’s better than you think) Wikipedia … In a proportional hazards model, the unique effect of a unit increase in a covariate is multiplicative with respect to the hazard rate. For example, taking a drug may halve one’s hazard rate for a stroke occurring, or, changing the material from which a manufactured component is constructed may double its hazard rate for failure. There are two main approaches to fitting Cox models in R. the coxph function in the survival package, and the cph function in the rms package. 22.1 Sources used in building this material David Diez’s excellent supplement for the OpenIntro Statistics project, on Survival Analysis in R. I’ve posted it on our web site, as well. Some tools in R to do some fancier work can be viewed at https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Survival.html You might also look at these two blog posts, originally from the Just Another Data blog. https://www.r-bloggers.com/survival-analysis-1/ https://www.r-bloggers.com/survival-analysis-2/ https://rpubs.com/daspringate/survival has some great slides, and I’ve stolen from them quite a bit here. 22.2 Fitting a Cox Model in R with coxph As a first example, I’ll fit a model to predict time to recurrence in the hem data, on the basis of a single predictor: genotype. cfit &lt;- with(hem, coxph(Surv(time, recur) ~ genotype)) cfit Call: coxph(formula = Surv(time, recur) ~ genotype) coef exp(coef) se(coef) z p genotype 1.33 3.79 0.57 2.34 0.019 Likelihood ratio test=6.61 on 1 df, p=0.0102 n= 70, number of events= 18 This summary provides an overall comparison of the two genotypes, using a proportional hazards model. The default approach in R is to use the “efron” method of breaking ties: other options include “breslow” and “exact”. 22.2.1 Summarizing the Fit summary(cfit) Call: coxph(formula = Surv(time, recur) ~ genotype) n= 70, number of events= 18 coef exp(coef) se(coef) z Pr(&gt;|z|) genotype 1.3317 3.7874 0.5699 2.337 0.0195 * --- Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 exp(coef) exp(-coef) lower .95 upper .95 genotype 3.787 0.264 1.239 11.57 Concordance= 0.622 (se = 0.065 ) Rsquare= 0.09 (max possible= 0.851 ) Likelihood ratio test= 6.61 on 1 df, p=0.01015 Wald test = 5.46 on 1 df, p=0.01946 Score (logrank) test = 6.28 on 1 df, p=0.01219 This provides estimates of the \\(\\beta\\) value for genotype, including standard errors and \\(p\\) values for a Wald test. Also included is an estimate of the hazard ratio and its confidence interval. Here we have a hazard ratio estimate of exp(coef) = 3.787, with 95% CI (1.24, 11.57). The hazard ratio is the multiplicative effect of the covariate (here, having at least one of the \\(\\epsilon 2\\) or \\(\\epsilon 4\\) allele) on the hazard function for recurrent hemorrhage A hazard ratio of 1 indicates no effect A hazard ratio &gt; 1 indicates an increase in the hazard as the covariate rises A hazard ratio &lt; 1 indicates a decrease in the hazard as the covariate rises We can also tidy the hazard ratio estimate with the broom package. tidy(cfit, exponentiate = TRUE) term estimate std.error statistic p.value conf.low conf.high 1 genotype 3.787366 0.5699005 2.336672 0.01945623 1.239473 11.57278 In addition, we have several other summaries: The concordance measure is only appropriate when we have at least one continuous predictor in our Cox model. The Cox &amp; Snell pseudo-R2 reflects the improvement of the model we’ve fit over the model with an intercept alone, but isn’t a proportion of anything (hence the listing of the maximum possible value). The Likelihood ratio, Wald and Score (logrank) tests provide insight into the overall significance of the model. We can obtain a more detailed description of the likelihood-ratio test of the model with anova. anova(cfit) Analysis of Deviance Table Cox model: response is Surv(time, recur) Terms added sequentially (first to last) loglik Chisq Df Pr(&gt;|Chi|) NULL -66.675 genotype -63.371 6.6078 1 0.01015 * --- Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 22.2.2 Glancing at the model? glance(cfit) n nevent statistic.log p.value.log statistic.sc p.value.sc 1 70 18 6.607825 0.01015316 6.283367 0.01218763 statistic.wald p.value.wald r.squared r.squared.max concordance 1 5.46 0.01945623 0.09007901 0.8511768 0.6220715 std.error.concordance logLik AIC BIC 1 0.06467615 -63.37095 128.7419 129.6323 Here, we obtain several additional summaries of the model, including most of the important information from a summary of cfit. 22.2.3 Plot the baseline survival function Here, we’ll plot the time in terms of months, but scaled to 12 month (one year) groups. plot(survfit(cfit), xscale = 12, xlab = &quot;Years after initial hemorrhage&quot;, ylab = &quot;Proportion without recurrent hemorrhage&quot;, main = &quot;Baseline Survival Function&quot;) 22.2.4 Plot the genotype effect There are several ways to build these plots. One approach follows. Another uses a cph fit and the survplot function from the rms package. newdat &lt;- with(hem, data.frame( genotype = c(1, 0) ) ) newdat genotype 1 1 2 0 plot(survfit(cfit, newdata = newdat), xscale = 12, conf.int = TRUE, col = c(&quot;red&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;), xlab = &quot;Years after initial hemorrhage&quot;, ylab = &quot;Proportion without recurrent hemorrhage&quot;, main = &quot;Plotting the genotype effects from the cfit Model&quot;) legend(0.5, 0.2, legend=c( expression(paste(&quot;Homozygous &quot;, epsilon, &quot;3 / &quot;, epsilon, &quot;3&quot;)), expression(paste(&quot;At least one &quot;, epsilon,&quot;2 or &quot;, epsilon,&quot;4 Allele&quot;)) ), lty = 1, col = c(&quot;red&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;), text.col = c(&quot;red&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;)) 22.2.5 Testing the Key Assumption: Proportional Hazards The cox.zph function in the survival package will test the proportionality of all of the predictors included in your model by creating interactions with time. A small \\(p\\) value would indicate a violation of the proportionality assumption. cox.zph(cfit, transform=&quot;km&quot;, global=TRUE) rho chisq p genotype 0.333 2.02 0.156 Since the p value here is not significant, we may be all right. But it’s sensible to focus further on plots derived from the model fit, rather than relying solely on this test. 22.2.6 Plotting the cox.zph results for the cfit model cox.zph function can be used to generate a plot for each of the individual predictors in the model. Of course, in this case, we have just one predictor: genotype. If the proportional hazards assumption is appropriate, then we should see a slope of essentially zero in each such plot. A slope that is seriously different from zero suggests a violation of the proportional hazards assumption. plot(cox.zph(cfit, transform=&quot;km&quot;, global=TRUE)) The plot suggests only a slight rise in the plotted values over time, suggesting no serious problem with the proportional hazards assumption. This combined testing and plotting approach is a reasonable starting place for assessing the proportional hazards assumption, but it’s likely insufficient for good practical work. Should the proportional hazards assumption fit less well, we have two main options: (1) fit a non-linear term in the covariate in question, and (2) fit a different type of regression model that doesn’t require the proportional hazards assumption. 22.3 Fitting a Cox Model using cph from the rms package To set up a cph fit for our comparison of genotypes in the hem data, we’ll follow these steps. units(hem$time) &lt;- &quot;month&quot; d &lt;- datadist(hem) options(datadist = &quot;d&quot;) hemsurv &lt;- Surv(time = hem$time, event = hem$recur) model_hem &lt;- cph(hemsurv ~ genotype, data = hem, x = TRUE, y = TRUE, surv = TRUE) Note that the surv = TRUE piece is required to get some of the follow-up analyses to work smoothly. 22.3.1 The Main cph results model_hem Cox Proportional Hazards Model cph(formula = hemsurv ~ genotype, data = hem, x = TRUE, y = TRUE, surv = TRUE) Model Tests Discrimination Indexes Obs 70 LR chi2 6.61 R2 0.106 Events 18 d.f. 1 Dxy 0.244 Center 0.7229 Pr(&gt; chi2) 0.0102 g 0.671 Score chi2 6.28 gr 1.955 Pr(&gt; chi2) 0.0122 Coef S.E. Wald Z Pr(&gt;|Z|) genotype 1.3317 0.5699 2.34 0.0195 Included here are likelihood ratio and score tests for the model as a whole (as compared to the intercept-only model), as well as the usual discrimination indexes. These include both an R2 analog due to Nagelkerke (which can go all the way up to 1), and Somers’ \\(Dxy\\), which can also produce an estimate of the C statistic (area under the curve) via the formula C = 0.5 + Dxy / 2, so here C = 0.5 + (.244/2) = 0.622 For lots more on survival analysis C statistics, look at the survAUC package in R. These results are followed by a table of Wald tests for each of the coefficients in the model. 22.3.2 Using anova with cph As in other rms fits, we can use anova to obtain more detailed (in terms of combining nonlinear terms and, if available, interactions) tests. anova(model_hem) Wald Statistics Response: hemsurv Factor Chi-Square d.f.

The function below correctly registers the survival time, and censors subjects who are alive at the end of the study (we need to indicate those whose times are known, and they are identified by alive == 0).

Model C: A model using age (with a restricted cubic spline), plab and maxtemp 23.2 Model A: coxph Model for Survival Time using age at diagnosis We’ll start by using age at diagnosis to predict our survival object (survival time, accounting for censoring). modA &lt;- coxph(Surv(months, alive==0) ~ age, data=leukem, model=TRUE) summary(modA) Call: coxph(formula = Surv(months, alive == 0) ~ age, data = leukem, model = TRUE) n= 51, number of events= 45 coef exp(coef) se(coef) z Pr(&gt;|z|) age 0.032397 1.032927 0.009521 3.403 0.000667 *** --- Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 exp(coef) exp(-coef) lower .95 upper .95 age 1.033 0.9681 1.014 1.052 Concordance= 0.65 (se = 0.057 ) Rsquare= 0.207 (max possible= 0.996 ) Likelihood ratio test= 11.85 on 1 df, p=0.000577 Wald test = 11.58 on 1 df, p=0.0006675 Score (logrank) test = 12.29 on 1 df, p=0.0004562 Across these 51 subjects, we observe 45 events (deaths) and 6 subjects are censored. The hazard ratio (shown under exp(coef)) is 1.0329272, and this means each additional year of age at diagnosis is associated with a 1.03-fold increase in the hazard of death. For this simple Cox regression model, we will focus on interpreting the hazard ratio (specified by the exp(coef) result and associated confidence interval) as a measure of effect size, Here, the hazard ratio associated with a 1-year increase in age is 1.033, and its 95% confidence interval is: (1.014, 1.052). Since this confidence interval ratio does not include 1 (barely), we can conclude that there is a significant association between age and stime at the 5% significance level. the concordance and Rsquare as measures of fit quality, and concordance is only appropriate when we have at least one continuous predictor in our Cox model, in which case it assesses the probability of agreement between the survival time and the risk score generated by the predictor (or set of predictors.) A value of 1 indicates perfect agreement, but values of 0.6 to 0.7 are more common in survival data. 0.5 is an agreement that is no better than chance. Here, our concordance is 0.65, which is a fairly typical value. Rsquare in this setting is Cox and Snell’s pseudo-R2, which reflects the improvement of the model we have fit over the model with the intercept alone - a comparison that is tested by the likelihood ratio test. The maximum value of this statistic is often less than one, in which case R will tell you that. Here, our observed pseudo-R2 is 0.207 and that is out of a possible maximum of 0.996. the significance tests, particularly the Wald test (shown next to the coefficient estimates in the position of a t test in linear regression), and the Likelihood ratio test at the bottom of the output, which compares this model to a null model which predicts the mean survival time for all subjects. The Wald test for an individual predictor compares the coefficient to its standard error, just like a t test in linear regression. The likelihood ratio test compares the entire model to the null model (intercept-only). Again, run an ANOVA (technically an analysis of deviance) to get more details on the likelihood-ratio test. anova(modA) Analysis of Deviance Table Cox model: response is Surv(months, alive == 0) Terms added sequentially (first to last) loglik Chisq Df Pr(&gt;|Chi|) NULL -142.94 age -137.02 11.849 1 0.000577 *** --- Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 23.2.1 Plotting the Survival Curve implied by Model A plot(survfit(modA), ylab=&quot;Probability of Survival&quot;, xlab=&quot;Months in Study&quot;, col=c(&quot;red&quot;, &quot;black&quot;, &quot;black&quot;)) 23.2.2 Testing the Proportional Hazards Assumption As we’ve noted, the key assumption in a Cox model is that the hazards are proportional. cox.zph(modA) rho chisq p age 0.147 0.791 0.374 A significant result here would indicate a problem with the proportional hazards assumption - again, not the case here. We can also plot the results: plot(cox.zph(modA)) We’re looking for the smooth curve to be fairly level across the time horizon here, as opposed to substantially increasing or decreasing in level as time passes. 23.3 Building Model A with cph for the leukem data units(leukem$months) &lt;- &quot;month&quot; d &lt;- datadist(leukem) options(datadist=&quot;d&quot;) modA_cph &lt;- cph(Surv(months, alive==0) ~ age, data=leukem, x=TRUE, y=TRUE, surv=TRUE, time.inc=12) modA_cph Cox Proportional Hazards Model cph(formula = Surv(months, alive == 0) ~ age, data = leukem, x = TRUE, y = TRUE, surv = TRUE, time.inc = 12) Model Tests Discrimination Indexes Obs 51 LR chi2 11.85 R2 0.208 Events 45 d.f. 1 Dxy 0.301 Center 1.6152 Pr(&gt; chi2) 0.0006 g 0.621 Score chi2 12.29 gr 1.861 Pr(&gt; chi2) 0.0005 Coef S.E.

We can plot the age effect implied by the model, using ggplot2, as follows… ggplot(Predict(modA_cph, age)) 23.3.2 Survival Plots (Kaplan-Meier) of the age effect The first survival plot I’ll show displays 95% confidence intervals for the probability of survival at the median age at diagnosis in the sample, which turns out to be 50 years, with numbers of patients still at risk indicated every 12 months of time in the study. We can substitute in conf = bars to get a different flavor for this sort of plot. survplot(modA_cph, age=median(leukem$age), conf.int=.95, col=&#39;blue&#39;, time.inc=12, n.risk=TRUE, conf=&#39;bands&#39;, type=&quot;kaplan-meier&quot;, xlab=&quot;Study Survival Time in Months&quot;) Or we can generate a survival plot that shows survival probabilities over time across a range of values for age at diagnosis, as follows… survplot(modA_cph, levels.only=TRUE, time.inc=12, type=&quot;kaplan-meier&quot;, xlab=&quot;Study Survival Time in Months&quot;) This plot shows a series of modeled survival probabilities, for five different diagnosis age levels, as identified by the labels. Generally we see that the younger the subject is at diagnosis, the longer their survival time in the study. 23.3.3 ANOVA test for the cph-built model for leukem We can run a likelihood-ratio (drop in deviance) test of the significance of the age effect… anova(modA_cph) Wald Statistics Response: Surv(months, alive == 0) Factor Chi-Square d.f. P age 11.57 1 7e-04 TOTAL 11.57 1 7e-04 23.3.4 Summarizing the Effect Sizes from modA_cph We can generate the usual summaries of effect size in this context, too. summary(modA_cph) Effects Response : Surv(months, alive == 0) Factor Low High Diff.

So the hazard ratio is 2.32, with 95% CI (1.43, 3.77) for the effect of moving 26 years. Our coxph version of this same model showed a hazard ratio for the effect of moving just a single year. 23.3.5 Validating the Cox Model Summary Statistics set.seed(432410); validate(modA_cph) index.orig training test optimism index.corrected n Dxy 0.3007 0.3060 0.3007 0.0053 0.2954 40 R2 0.2081 0.2078 0.2081 -0.0003 0.2084 40 Slope 1.0000 1.0000 1.0495 -0.0495 1.0495 40 D 0.0379 0.0388 0.0379 0.0008 0.0371 40 U -0.0070 -0.0070 0.0032 -0.0102 0.0032 40 Q 0.0449 0.0457 0.0348 0.0110 0.0340 40 g 0.6210 0.6189 0.6210 -0.0021 0.6231 40 The R2 statistic barely moves, and neither does the Somers’ d estimate, so at least in this simple model, the nominal summary statistics are likely to hold up pretty well in new data. 23.3.6 Looking for Influential Points This plot shows the influence of each point, in terms of DFBETA - the impact on the coefficient of age in the model were that specific point to be removed from the data set. We can also identify the row numbers of the largest (positive and negative) DFBETAs. plot(residuals(modA_cph, type=&quot;dfbeta&quot;, collapse = leukem$id) ~ leukem$id, main=&quot;Index Plot of DFBETA for Age&quot;, type=&quot;h&quot;, ylab=&quot;DFBETA in modelA_cph&quot;) which.max(residuals(modA_cph, type=&quot;dfbeta&quot;)) 8 8 which.min(residuals(modA_cph, type=&quot;dfbeta&quot;)) 50 50 The DFBETAs look very small here. Changes in the \\(\\beta\\) estimates as large as 0.002 don’t have a meaningful impact in this case, so I don’t see anything particularly influential. 23.3.7 Checking the Proportional Hazards Assumption As before, we can check the proportional hazards assumption with a test, or plot. cox.zph(modA_cph) rho chisq p age 0.147 0.791 0.374 plot(cox.zph(modA_cph)) Still no serious signs of trouble, of course. We’ll see what happens when we fit a bigger model. 23.4 Model B: Fitting a 5-Predictor Model with coxph Next, we use the coxph function from the survival package to apply a Cox regression model to predict the survival time using the main effects of the five predictors: age, pblasts, pinf, plab and maxtemp. modB &lt;- coxph(Surv(months, alive==0) ~ age + pblasts + pinf + plab + maxtemp, data=leukem) modB Call: coxph(formula = Surv(months, alive == 0) ~ age + pblasts + pinf + plab + maxtemp, data = leukem) coef exp(coef) se(coef) z p age 0.03308 1.03363 0.01016 3.26 0.0011 pblasts 0.00945 1.00950 0.01396 0.68 0.4983 pinf -0.01710 0.98304 0.01224 -1.40 0.1625 plab -0.06600 0.93613 0.03865 -1.71 0.0877 maxtemp 0.15545 1.16818 0.11198 1.39 0.1651 Likelihood ratio test=18.5 on 5 df, p=0.00241 n= 51, number of events= 45 The Wald tests suggest that age and perhaps plab are the only terms which appear to be significant after accounting for the other predictors in the model. 23.4.1 Interpreting the Results from Model B summary(modB) Call: coxph(formula = Surv(months, alive == 0) ~ age + pblasts + pinf + plab + maxtemp, data = leukem) n= 51, number of events= 45 coef exp(coef) se(coef) z Pr(&gt;|z|) age 0.033080 1.033633 0.010163 3.255 0.00113 ** pblasts 0.009452 1.009497 0.013959 0.677 0.49831 pinf -0.017102 0.983043 0.012244 -1.397 0.16248 plab -0.066000 0.936131 0.038651 -1.708 0.08771 . maxtemp 0.155448 1.168182 0.111978 1.388 0.16507 --- Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 exp(coef) exp(-coef) lower .95 upper .95 age 1.0336 0.9675 1.0132 1.054 pblasts 1.0095 0.9906 0.9823 1.037 pinf 0.9830 1.0172 0.9597 1.007 plab 0.9361 1.0682 0.8678 1.010 maxtemp 1.1682 0.8560 0.9380 1.455 Concordance= 0.705 (se = 0.057 ) Rsquare= 0.304 (max possible= 0.996 ) Likelihood ratio test= 18.48 on 5 df, p=0.002405 Wald test = 17.62 on 5 df, p=0.003466 Score (logrank) test = 18.96 on 5 df, p=0.001953 Again, it appears that only age has a statistically significant effect, as last predictor in. anova(modB) Analysis of Deviance Table Cox model: response is Surv(months, alive == 0) Terms added sequentially (first to last) loglik Chisq Df Pr(&gt;|Chi|) NULL -142.94 age -137.02 11.8488 1 0.000577 *** pblasts -136.64 0.7537 1 0.385319 pinf -135.77 1.7308 1 0.188314 plab -134.60 2.3370 1 0.126334 maxtemp -133.70 1.8057 1 0.179022 --- Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 At least taken in this order, none of the variables appear to add significant predictive value, given that we have already accounted for the preceding variables. 23.4.2 Plotting the Survival Curve implied by Model B plot(survfit(modB), ylab=&quot;Probability of Survival&quot;, xlab=&quot;Months in Study&quot;, col=c(&quot;red&quot;, &quot;black&quot;, &quot;black&quot;)) The crosses in the plot indicate censoring points, while the drops indicate people who have died, and are thus no longer at risk. 23.4.3 Plotting the Cumulative Hazard implied by Model B plot(survfit(modB, type=&quot;fleming&quot;), col=c(&quot;blue&quot;, &quot;black&quot;, &quot;black&quot;), fun=&quot;cumhaz&quot;, ylab=&quot;Cumulative Hazard&quot;, xlab=&quot;Months in Study&quot;) 23.4.4 Testing the Proportional Hazards Assumption cox.zph(modB, transform=&quot;km&quot;, global=TRUE) rho chisq p age 0.1875 1.408 0.235 pblasts -0.1036 0.412 0.521 pinf -0.0962 0.359 0.549 plab 0.1810 1.784 0.182 maxtemp -0.2182 2.278 0.131 GLOBAL NA 8.852 0.115 Note that we get a global test, and a separate test for each predictor.

We can plot the scaled Schoenfeld residuals directly with ggcoxzph from the survminer package. ggcoxzph(cox.zph(modB)) 23.4.5 Assessing Collinearity Perhaps we have some collinearity here, which might imply that we could sensibly fit a smaller model, which would be appealing anyway, with only 45 actual events - we should probably be sticking to a model with no more than 2 or perhaps as many as 3 coefficients to be estimated. vif(modB) age pblasts pinf plab maxtemp 1.081775 3.029862 3.000944 1.035400 1.045249 The variance inflation factors don’t look enormous - it may be that removing one of these variables will help make the others look more significant. Let’s consider a stepwise variable selection algorithm to see what results… Note that the leaps library, which generates best subsets output, is designed for linear regression, as is the lars library, which generates the lasso. Either could be used here for some guidance, but not with the survival object stime = Surv(months, age) as the response, but instead only with months as the outcome, which ignores the censoring. The step procedure can be used on the survival object, though. 23.5 Model B2: A Stepwise Reduction of Model B step(modB) Start: AIC=277.4 Surv(months, alive == 0) ~ age + pblasts + pinf + plab + maxtemp Df AIC - pblasts 1 275.85 - pinf 1 277.17 - maxtemp 1 277.21 &lt;none&gt; 277.40 - plab 1 278.42 - age 1 286.47 Step: AIC=275.85 Surv(months, alive == 0) ~ age + pinf + plab + maxtemp Df AIC - maxtemp 1 275.63 &lt;none&gt; 275.85 - pinf 1 275.89 - plab 1 276.86 - age 1 284.47 Step: AIC=275.63 Surv(months, alive == 0) ~ age + pinf + plab Df AIC &lt;none&gt; 275.63 - pinf 1 275.69 - plab 1 275.95 - age 1 285.52 Call: coxph(formula = Surv(months, alive == 0) ~ age + pinf + plab, data = leukem) coef exp(coef) se(coef) z p age 0.03317 1.03373 0.00973 3.41 0.00065 pinf -0.01015 0.98990 0.00709 -1.43 0.15225 plab -0.05756 0.94407 0.03848 -1.50 0.13466 Likelihood ratio test=16.2 on 3 df, p=0.00101 n= 51, number of events= 45 The stepwise procedure lands on a model with three predictors.

Quoting Harrell (page 529, RMS second edition): The bootstrap is used to estimate the optimism in how well predicted [one]-year survival from the final Cox model tracks flexible smooth estimates, without any binning of predicted survival probabilities or assuming proportional hazards. The u variable specifies the length of time at which we look at the calibration. I’ve specified the units earlier to be months. set.seed(43233); plot(rms::calibrate(modC, B = 10, u = 12)) Using Cox survival estimates at 12 months The model seems neither especially well calibrated nor especially poorly so - looking at the comparison of the blue curve to the gray, our predictions basically aren’t aggressive enough - more people are surviving to a year in our low predicted probability of 12 month survival group, and fewer people are surviving on the high end of the x-axis than should be the case.
