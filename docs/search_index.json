Love, Ph.D. Version: 2018-01-15 Introduction These Notes provide a series of examples using R to work through issues that are likely to come up in PQHS/CRSP/MPHP 432. While these Notes share some of the features of a textbook, they are neither comprehensive nor completely original. The main purpose is to give 432 students a set of common materials on which to draw during the course. In class, we will sometimes: reiterate points made in this document, amplify what is here, simplify the presentation of things done here, use new examples to show some of the same techniques, refer to issues not mentioned in this document, but what we don’t do is follow these notes very precisely. We assume instead that you will read the materials and try to learn from them, just as you will attend classes and try to learn from them. We welcome feedback of all kinds on this document or anything else. Just email us at 431-help at case dot edu, or submit a pull request. What you will mostly find are brief explanations of a key idea or summary, accompanied (most of the time) by R code and a demonstration of the results of applying that code. Everything you see here is available to you as HTML or PDF. You will also have access to the R Markdown files, which contain the code which generates everything in the document, including all of the R results. We will demonstrate the use of R Markdown (this document is generated with the additional help of an R package called bookdown) and R Studio (the “program” which we use to interface with the R language) in class. To download the data and R code related to these notes, visit the Data and Code section of the 432 course website. "],

["building-table-1.html", "Chapter 1 Building Table 1 1.1 Two examples from the New England Journal of Medicine 1.2 Simulating Data from a Clinical Trial", " Chapter 1 Building Table 1 Many scientific articles involve direct comparison of results from various exposures, perhaps treatments. In 431, we studied numerous methods, including various sorts of hypothesis tests, confidence intervals, and descriptive summaries, which can help us to understand and compare outcomes in such a setting. One common approach is to present what’s often called Table 1. Table 1 provides a summary of the characteristics of a sample, or of groups of samples, which is most commonly used to help understand the nature of the data being compared. 1.1 Two examples from the New England Journal of Medicine 1.1.1 A simple Table 1 Table 1 is especially common in the context of clinical research. Consider the excerpt below, from a January 2015 article in the New England Journal of Medicine (Tolaney et al. 2015). This (partial) table reports baseline characteristics on age group, sex and race, describing 406 patients with HER2-positive1 invasive breast cancer that began the protocol therapy. Age, sex and race (along with severity of illness) are the most commonly identified characteristics in a Table 1. In addition to the measures shown in this excerpt, the full Table also includes detailed information on the primary tumor for each patient, including its size, nodal status and histologic grade. Footnotes tell us that the percentages shown are subject to rounding, and may not total 100, and that the race information was self-reported. 1.1.2 Table 1 showing a group comparison A more typical Table 1 involves a group comparison, for example in this excerpt from Roy et al. (2008). This Table 1 describes a multi-center randomized clinical trial comparing two different approaches to caring for patients with heart failure and atrial fibrillation2. The article provides percentages, means and standard deviations across groups, but note that it does not provide p values for the comparison of baseline characteristics. This is a common feature of NEJM reports on randomized clinical trials, where we anticipate that the two groups will be well matched at baseline. Note that the patients in this study were randomly assigned to either the rhythm-control group or to the rate-control group, using blocked randomizations stratified by study center. 1.2 Simulating Data from a Clinical Trial Consider the following simulated data, available on the Data and Code page of our course website in the fakestroke.csv file, which I built to let us mirror the Table 1 for a real randomized clinical trial, called MR CLEAN (Berkheimer et al. 2015). The MR CLEAN trial report describes 500 patients with acute ischemic stroke at 16 medical centers in the Netherlands, where 233 were randomly assigned to the intervention (intraarterial treatment plus usual care) and 267 to control (usual care alone.) 1.2.1 The fakestroke data Here’s a quick look at the simulated data in fakestroke. fakestroke # A tibble: 500 x 18 studyid trt age sex nihss location hx.isch afib dm mrankin &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;fct&gt; 1 z001 Control 53.0 Male 21 Right No 0 0 2 2 z002 Interve~ 51.0 Male 23 Left No 1 0 0 3 z003 Control 68.0 Fema~ 11 Right No 0 0 0 4 z004 Control 28.0 Male 22 Left No 0 0 0 5 z005 Control 91.0 Male 24 Right No 0 0 0 6 z006 Control 34.0 Fema~ 18 Left No 0 0 2 7 z007 Interve~ 75.0 Male 25 Right No 0 0 0 8 z008 Control 89.0 Fema~ 18 Right No 0 0 0 9 z009 Control 75.0 Male 25 Left No 1 0 2 10 z010 Interve~ 26.0 Fema~ 27 Right No 0 0 0 # ... with 490 more rows, and 8 more variables: sbp &lt;int&gt;, iv.altep &lt;fct&gt;, # time.iv &lt;int&gt;, aspects &lt;int&gt;, ia.occlus &lt;fct&gt;, extra.ica &lt;int&gt;, # time.rand &lt;int&gt;, time.punc &lt;int&gt; The fakestroke.csv file contains the following 18 variables for 500 patients. Variable Description studyid Study ID # (z001 through z500) trt Treatment group (Intervention or Control) age Age in years sex Male or Female nihss NIH Stroke Scale Score (can range from 0-42; higher scores indicate more severe neurological deficits) location Stroke Location - Left or Right Hemisphere hx.isch History of Ischemic Stroke (Yes/No) afib Atrial Fibrillation (1 = Yes, 0 = No) dm Diabetes Mellitus (1 = Yes, 0 = No) mrankin Pre-stroke modified Rankin scale score (0, 1, 2 or &gt; 2) indicating functional disability - complete range is 0 (no symptoms) to 6 (death) sbp Systolic blood pressure, in mm Hg iv.altep Treatment with IV alteplase (Yes/No) time.iv Time from stroke onset to start of IV altepase (minutes) if iv.altep=Yes aspects Alberta Stroke Program Early Computed Tomography score, which measures extent of stroke from 0 - 10; higher scores indicate fewer early ischemic changes ia.occlus Intracranial arterial occlusion, based on vessel imaging - five categories3 extra.ica Extracranial ICA occlusion (1 = Yes, 0 = No) time.rand Time from stroke onset to study randomization, in minutes time.punc Time from stroke onset to groin puncture, in minutes (only if Intervention) 1.2.2 fakestroke Table 1: Attempt 1 Our goal, then, is to take the data in fakestroke.csv and use it to generate a Table 1 for the study that compares the 233 patients in the Intervention group to the 267 patients in the Control group, on all of the other variables (except study ID #) available. I’ll use the tableone package of functions available in R to help me complete this task. We’ll make a first attempt, using the CreateTableOne function in the tableone package. To use the function, we’ll need to specify: the vars or variables we want to place in the rows of our Table 1 (which will include just about everything in the fakestroke data except the studyid code and the trt variable for which we have other plans) A useful trick here is to use the dput function, specifically something like dput(names(fakestroke)) can be used to generate a list of all of the variables included in the fakestroke tibble, and then this can be copied and pasted into the vars specification, saving some typing. the strata which indicates the levels want to use in the columns of our Table 1 (for us, that’s trt) fs.vars &lt;- c(&quot;age&quot;, &quot;sex&quot;, &quot;nihss&quot;, &quot;location&quot;, &quot;hx.isch&quot;, &quot;afib&quot;, &quot;dm&quot;, &quot;mrankin&quot;, &quot;sbp&quot;, &quot;iv.altep&quot;, &quot;time.iv&quot;, &quot;aspects&quot;, &quot;ia.occlus&quot;, &quot;extra.ica&quot;, &quot;time.rand&quot;, &quot;time.punc&quot;) fs.trt &lt;- c(&quot;trt&quot;) att1 &lt;- CreateTableOne(data = fakestroke, vars = fs.vars, strata = fs.trt) print(att1) Stratified by trt Control Intervention p test n 267 233 age (mean (sd)) 65.38 (16.10) 63.93 (18.09) 0.343 sex = Male (%) 157 (58.8) 135 (57.9) 0.917 nihss (mean (sd)) 18.08 (4.32) 17.97 (5.04) 0.787 location = Right (%) 114 (42.7) 117 (50.2) 0.111 hx.isch = Yes (%) 25 ( 9.4) 29 (12.4) 0.335 afib (mean (sd)) 0.26 (0.44) 0.28 (0.45) 0.534 dm (mean (sd)) 0.13 (0.33) 0.12 (0.33) 0.923 mrankin (%) 0.922 &gt; 2 11 ( 4.1) 10 ( 4.3) 0 214 (80.1) 190 (81.5) 1 29 (10.9) 21 ( 9.0) 2 13 ( 4.9) 12 ( 5.2) sbp (mean (sd)) 145.00 (24.40) 146.03 (26.00) 0.647 iv.altep = Yes (%) 242 (90.6) 203 (87.1) 0.267 time.iv (mean (sd)) 87.96 (26.01) 98.22 (45.48) 0.003 aspects (mean (sd)) 8.65 (1.47) 8.35 (1.64) 0.033 ia.occlus (%) 0.795 A1 or A2 2 ( 0.8) 1 ( 0.4) ICA with M1 75 (28.2) 59 (25.3) Intracranial ICA 3 ( 1.1) 1 ( 0.4) M1 165 (62.0) 154 (66.1) M2 21 ( 7.9) 18 ( 7.7) extra.ica (mean (sd)) 0.26 (0.44) 0.32 (0.47) 0.150 time.rand (mean (sd)) 213.88 (70.29) 202.51 (57.33) 0.051 time.punc (mean (sd)) NaN (NA) 263.02 (54.23) NA Some of this is very useful, and other parts need to be fixed. The 1/0 variables (afib, dm, extra.ica) might be better if they were treated as the factors they are, and reported as the Yes/No variables are reported, with counts and percentages rather than with means and standard deviations. In some cases, we may prefer to re-order the levels of the categorical (factor) variables, particularly the mrankin variable, but also the ia.occlus variable. It would also be more typical to put the Intervention group to the left and the Control group to the right, so we may need to adjust our trt variable’s levels accordingly. For each of the quantitative variables (age, nihss, sbp, time.iv, aspects, extra.ica, time.rand and time.punc) we should make a decision whether a summary with mean and standard deviation is appropriate, or whether we should instead summarize with, say, the median and quartiles. A mean and standard deviation really only yields an appropriate summary when the data are least approximately Normally distributed. This will make the p values a bit more reasonable, too. The test column in the first attempt will soon have something useful to tell us. We’ve got some warnings (which I’ve silenced here), having to do with the fact that time.punc is only relevant to patients in the Intervention group. We might consider removing that variable from this table, as a result, and summarizing those data separately. 1.2.3 fakestroke Cleaning Up Categorical Variables Let’s specify each of the categorical variables as categorical explicitly. This helps the CreateTableOne function treat them appropriately, and display them with counts and percentages. This includes all of the 1/0, Yes/No and multi-categorical variables. fs.factorvars &lt;- c(&quot;sex&quot;, &quot;location&quot;, &quot;hx.isch&quot;, &quot;afib&quot;, &quot;dm&quot;, &quot;mrankin&quot;, &quot;iv.altep&quot;, &quot;ia.occlus&quot;, &quot;extra.ica&quot;) Then we simply add a factorVars = fs.factorvars call to the CreateTableOne function. We also want to re-order some of those categorical variables, so that the levels are more useful to us. Specifically, we want to: place Intervention before Control in the trt variable, reorder the mrankin scale as 0, 1, 2, &gt; 2, and rearrange the ia.occlus variable to the order4 presented in Berkheimer et al. (2015). To accomplish this, we’ll use the fct_relevel function from the forcats package (loaded with the rest of the core tidyverse packages) to reorder our levels manually. fakestroke &lt;- fakestroke %&gt;% mutate(trt = fct_relevel(trt, &quot;Intervention&quot;, &quot;Control&quot;), mrankin = fct_relevel(mrankin, &quot;0&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;&gt; 2&quot;), ia.occlus = fct_relevel(ia.occlus, &quot;Intracranial ICA&quot;, &quot;ICA with M1&quot;, &quot;M1&quot;, &quot;M2&quot;, &quot;A1 or A2&quot;) ) 1.2.4 fakestroke Table 1: Attempt 2 att2 &lt;- CreateTableOne(data = fakestroke, vars = fs.vars, factorVars = fs.factorvars, strata = fs.trt) print(att2) Stratified by trt Intervention Control p test n 233 267 age (mean (sd)) 63.93 (18.09) 65.38 (16.10) 0.343 sex = Male (%) 135 (57.9) 157 (58.8) 0.917 nihss (mean (sd)) 17.97 (5.04) 18.08 (4.32) 0.787 location = Right (%) 117 (50.2) 114 (42.7) 0.111 hx.isch = Yes (%) 29 (12.4) 25 ( 9.4) 0.335 afib = 1 (%) 66 (28.3) 69 (25.8) 0.601 dm = 1 (%) 29 (12.4) 34 (12.7) 1.000 mrankin (%) 0.922 0 190 (81.5) 214 (80.1) 1 21 ( 9.0) 29 (10.9) 2 12 ( 5.2) 13 ( 4.9) &gt; 2 10 ( 4.3) 11 ( 4.1) sbp (mean (sd)) 146.03 (26.00) 145.00 (24.40) 0.647 iv.altep = Yes (%) 203 (87.1) 242 (90.6) 0.267 time.iv (mean (sd)) 98.22 (45.48) 87.96 (26.01) 0.003 aspects (mean (sd)) 8.35 (1.64) 8.65 (1.47) 0.033 ia.occlus (%) 0.795 Intracranial ICA 1 ( 0.4) 3 ( 1.1) ICA with M1 59 (25.3) 75 (28.2) M1 154 (66.1) 165 (62.0) M2 18 ( 7.7) 21 ( 7.9) A1 or A2 1 ( 0.4) 2 ( 0.8) extra.ica = 1 (%) 75 (32.2) 70 (26.3) 0.179 time.rand (mean (sd)) 202.51 (57.33) 213.88 (70.29) 0.051 time.punc (mean (sd)) 263.02 (54.23) NaN (NA) NA The categorical data presentation looks much improved. 1.2.5 What summaries should we show? Now, we’ll move on to the issue of making a decision about what type of summary to show for the quantitative variables. Since the fakestroke data are just simulated and only match the summary statistics of the original results, not the details, we’ll adopt the decisions made by Berkheimer et al. (2015), which was to use medians and interquartile ranges to summarize the distributions of all of the continuous variables except systolic blood pressure. Specifying certain quantitative variables as non-normal causes R to show them with medians and the 25th and 75th percentiles, rather than means and standard deviations, and also causes those variables to be tested using non-parametric tests, like the Wilcoxon signed rank test, rather than the t test. The test column indicates this with the word nonnorm. Specifying exact tests for certain categorical variables (we’ll try this for the location and mrankin variables) can be done, and these changes will be noted in the test column, as well. To accomplish this, we need to specify which variables should be treated as non-Normal in the print statement - notice that we don’t need to redo the CreateTableOne for this change. print(att2, nonnormal = c(&quot;age&quot;, &quot;nihss&quot;, &quot;time.iv&quot;, &quot;aspects&quot;, &quot;time.rand&quot;, &quot;time.punc&quot;), exact = c(&quot;location&quot;, &quot;mrankin&quot;)) Stratified by trt Intervention Control n 233 267 age (median [IQR]) 65.80 [54.50, 76.00] 65.70 [55.75, 76.20] sex = Male (%) 135 (57.9) 157 (58.8) nihss (median [IQR]) 17.00 [14.00, 21.00] 18.00 [14.00, 22.00] location = Right (%) 117 (50.2) 114 (42.7) hx.isch = Yes (%) 29 (12.4) 25 ( 9.4) afib = 1 (%) 66 (28.3) 69 (25.8) dm = 1 (%) 29 (12.4) 34 (12.7) mrankin (%) 0 190 (81.5) 214 (80.1) 1 21 ( 9.0) 29 (10.9) 2 12 ( 5.2) 13 ( 4.9) &gt; 2 10 ( 4.3) 11 ( 4.1) sbp (mean (sd)) 146.03 (26.00) 145.00 (24.40) iv.altep = Yes (%) 203 (87.1) 242 (90.6) time.iv (median [IQR]) 85.00 [67.00, 110.00] 87.00 [65.00, 116.00] aspects (median [IQR]) 9.00 [7.00, 10.00] 9.00 [8.00, 10.00] ia.occlus (%) Intracranial ICA 1 ( 0.4) 3 ( 1.1) ICA with M1 59 (25.3) 75 (28.2) M1 154 (66.1) 165 (62.0) M2 18 ( 7.7) 21 ( 7.9) A1 or A2 1 ( 0.4) 2 ( 0.8) extra.ica = 1 (%) 75 (32.2) 70 (26.3) time.rand (median [IQR]) 204.00 [152.00, 249.50] 196.00 [149.00, 266.00] time.punc (median [IQR]) 260.00 [212.00, 313.00] NA [NA, NA] Stratified by trt p test n age (median [IQR]) 0.579 nonnorm sex = Male (%) 0.917 nihss (median [IQR]) 0.453 nonnorm location = Right (%) 0.106 exact hx.isch = Yes (%) 0.335 afib = 1 (%) 0.601 dm = 1 (%) 1.000 mrankin (%) 0.917 exact 0 1 2 &gt; 2 sbp (mean (sd)) 0.647 iv.altep = Yes (%) 0.267 time.iv (median [IQR]) 0.596 nonnorm aspects (median [IQR]) 0.075 nonnorm ia.occlus (%) 0.795 Intracranial ICA ICA with M1 M1 M2 A1 or A2 extra.ica = 1 (%) 0.179 time.rand (median [IQR]) 0.251 nonnorm time.punc (median [IQR]) NA nonnorm 1.2.6 Obtaining a Detailed Summary If this was a real data set, we’d want to get a more detailed description of the data to make decisions about things like potentially collapsing categories of a variable, or whether or not a normal distribution was useful for a particular continuous variable, etc. You can do this with the summary command applied to a created Table 1, which shows, among other things, the effect of changing from normal to non-normal p values for continuous variables, and from approximate to “exact” p values for categorical factors. Note in the summary below that we have some missing values here. Often, we’ll present this information within the Table 1, as well. summary(att2) ### Summary of continuous variables ### trt: Intervention n miss p.miss mean sd median p25 p75 min max skew kurt age 233 0 0.0 64 18 66 54 76 23 96 -0.34 -0.52 nihss 233 0 0.0 18 5 17 14 21 10 28 0.48 -0.74 sbp 233 0 0.0 146 26 146 129 164 78 214 -0.07 -0.22 time.iv 233 30 12.9 98 45 85 67 110 42 218 1.03 0.08 aspects 233 0 0.0 8 2 9 7 10 5 10 -0.56 -0.98 time.rand 233 2 0.9 203 57 204 152 250 100 300 0.01 -1.16 time.punc 233 0 0.0 263 54 260 212 313 180 360 0.11 -1.33 -------------------------------------------------------- trt: Control n miss p.miss mean sd median p25 p75 min max skew kurt age 267 0 0.0 65 16 66 56 76 24 94 -0.296 -0.28 nihss 267 0 0.0 18 4 18 14 22 11 25 0.017 -1.24 sbp 267 1 0.4 145 24 145 128 161 82 231 0.156 0.08 time.iv 267 25 9.4 88 26 87 65 116 44 130 0.001 -1.32 aspects 267 4 1.5 9 1 9 8 10 5 10 -1.071 0.36 time.rand 267 0 0.0 214 70 196 149 266 120 360 0.508 -0.93 time.punc 267 267 100.0 NaN NA NA NA NA Inf -Inf NaN NaN p-values pNormal pNonNormal age 0.342813660 0.57856976 nihss 0.787487252 0.45311695 sbp 0.647157646 0.51346132 time.iv 0.003073372 0.59641104 aspects 0.032662901 0.07464683 time.rand 0.050803672 0.25134327 time.punc NA NA Standardize mean differences 1 vs 2 age 0.08478764 nihss 0.02405390 sbp 0.04100833 time.iv 0.27691223 aspects 0.19210662 time.rand 0.17720957 time.punc NA ======================================================================================= ### Summary of categorical variables ### trt: Intervention var n miss p.miss level freq percent cum.percent sex 233 0 0.0 Female 98 42.1 42.1 Male 135 57.9 100.0 location 233 0 0.0 Left 116 49.8 49.8 Right 117 50.2 100.0 hx.isch 233 0 0.0 No 204 87.6 87.6 Yes 29 12.4 100.0 afib 233 0 0.0 0 167 71.7 71.7 1 66 28.3 100.0 dm 233 0 0.0 0 204 87.6 87.6 1 29 12.4 100.0 mrankin 233 0 0.0 0 190 81.5 81.5 1 21 9.0 90.6 2 12 5.2 95.7 &gt; 2 10 4.3 100.0 iv.altep 233 0 0.0 No 30 12.9 12.9 Yes 203 87.1 100.0 ia.occlus 233 0 0.0 Intracranial ICA 1 0.4 0.4 ICA with M1 59 25.3 25.8 M1 154 66.1 91.8 M2 18 7.7 99.6 A1 or A2 1 0.4 100.0 extra.ica 233 0 0.0 0 158 67.8 67.8 1 75 32.2 100.0 -------------------------------------------------------- trt: Control var n miss p.miss level freq percent cum.percent sex 267 0 0.0 Female 110 41.2 41.2 Male 157 58.8 100.0 location 267 0 0.0 Left 153 57.3 57.3 Right 114 42.7 100.0 hx.isch 267 0 0.0 No 242 90.6 90.6 Yes 25 9.4 100.0 afib 267 0 0.0 0 198 74.2 74.2 1 69 25.8 100.0 dm 267 0 0.0 0 233 87.3 87.3 1 34 12.7 100.0 mrankin 267 0 0.0 0 214 80.1 80.1 1 29 10.9 91.0 2 13 4.9 95.9 &gt; 2 11 4.1 100.0 iv.altep 267 0 0.0 No 25 9.4 9.4 Yes 242 90.6 100.0 ia.occlus 267 1 0.4 Intracranial ICA 3 1.1 1.1 ICA with M1 75 28.2 29.3 M1 165 62.0 91.4 M2 21 7.9 99.2 A1 or A2 2 0.8 100.0 extra.ica 267 1 0.4 0 196 73.7 73.7 1 70 26.3 100.0 p-values pApprox pExact sex 0.9171387 0.8561188 location 0.1113553 0.1056020 hx.isch 0.3352617 0.3124683 afib 0.6009691 0.5460206 dm 1.0000000 1.0000000 mrankin 0.9224798 0.9173657 iv.altep 0.2674968 0.2518374 ia.occlus 0.7945580 0.8189090 extra.ica 0.1793385 0.1667574 Standardize mean differences 1 vs 2 sex 0.017479025 location 0.151168444 hx.isch 0.099032275 afib 0.055906317 dm 0.008673478 mrankin 0.062543164 iv.altep 0.111897009 ia.occlus 0.117394890 extra.ica 0.129370206 Again, I have simulated the data to mirror the results in the published Table 1 for this study. In no way have I captured the full range of the real data, or any of the relationships in that data, so it’s more important here to see what’s available in the analysis, rather than to interpret it closely in the clinical context.
