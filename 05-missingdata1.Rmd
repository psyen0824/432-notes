# Missing Data Mechanisms and Single Imputation

Almost all serious statistical analyses have to deal with missing data. Data values that are missing are indicated in R, and to R, by the symbol `NA`.

## A Toy Example

In the following tiny data set called `sbp_example`, we have four variables for a set of 15 subjects. In addition to a subject id, we have:

- the treatment this subject received (A, B or C are the treatments),
- an indicator (1 = yes, 0 = no) of whether the subject has diabetes,
- the subject's systolic blood pressure at baseline
- the subject's systolic blood pressure after the application of the treatment

```{r build sbp_example data set}
# create some temporary variables

subject <- 101:115
x1 <- c("A", "B", "C", "A", "C", "A", "A", NA, "B", "C", "A", "B", "C", "A", "B")
x2 <- c(1, 0, 0, 1, NA, 1, 0, 1, NA, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, NA)
x3 <- c(120, 145, 150, NA, 155, NA, 135, NA, 115, 170, 150, 145, 140, 160, 135)
x4 <- c(105, 135, 150, 120, 135, 115, 160, 150, 130, 155, 140, 140, 150, 135, 120)

sbp_example <- 
  data.frame(subject, treat = x1, diabetes = x2, 
             sbp.before = x3, sbp.after = x4) %>%
  tbl_df

rm(subject, x1, x2, x3, x4) # just cleaning up

sbp_example
```

### How many missing values do we have in each column?

```{r}
colSums(is.na(sbp_example))
```

We are missing one `treat`, 3 `diabetes` and 3 `sbp.before` values.

### What is the pattern of missing data?

```{r}
mice::md.pattern(sbp_example)
```

We have nine subjects with complete data, three subjects with missing `diabetes` (only), two subjects with missing `sbp.before` (only), and 1 subject with missing `treat` and `sbp.before`.

### How can we identify the subjects with missing data?

```{r}
sbp_example %>% filter(!complete.cases(.))
```

## Missing-data mechanisms

My source for this description of mechanisms is Chapter 25 of @GelmanHill2007, and that chapter is [available at this link](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/arm/missing.pdf).

1. **MCAR = Missingness completely at random**. A variable is missing completely at random if the probability of missingness is the same for all units, for example, if for each subject, we decide whether to collect the `diabetes` status by rolling a die and refusing to answer if a "6" shows up. If data are missing completely at random, then throwing out cases with missing data does not bias your inferences.
2. **Missingness that depends only on observed predictors**. A more general assumption, called **missing at random** or **MAR**, is that the probability a variable is missing depends only on available information. Here, we would have to be willing to assume that the probability of nonresponse to `diabetes` depends only on the other, fully recorded variables in the data. It is often reasonable to model this process as a logistic regression, where the outcome variable equals 1 for observed cases and 0 for missing. When an outcome variable is missing at random, it is acceptable to exclude the missing cases (that is, to treat them as NA), as long as the regression controls for all the variables that affect the probability of missingness.
3. **Missingness that depends on unobserved predictors**. Missingness is no longer "at random" if it depends on information that has not been recorded and this information also predicts the missing values. If a particular treatment causes discomfort, a patient is more likely to drop out of the study. This missingness is not at random (unless "discomfort" is measured and observed for all patients). If missingness is not at random, it must be explicitly modeled, or else you must accept some bias in your inferences.
4. **Missingness that depends on the missing value itself.** Finally, a particularly difficult situation arises when the probability of missingness depends on the (potentially missing) variable itself. For example, suppose that people with higher earnings are less likely to reveal them.

Essentially, situations 3 and 4 are referred to collectively as **non-random missingness**, and cause more trouble for us than 1 and 2.

## Options for Dealing with Missingness

There are several available methods for dealing with missing data that are MCAR or MAR, but they basically boil down to:

- Complete Case (or Available Case) analyses
- Single Imputation
- Multiple Imputation

## Complete Case (and Available Case) analyses

In **Complete Case** analyses, rows containing NA values are omitted from the data before analyses commence. This is the default approach for many statistical software packages, and may introduce unpredictable bias and fail to include some useful, often hard-won information.

- A complete case analysis can be appropriate when the number of missing observations is not large, and the missing pattern is either MCAR (missing completely at random) or MAR (missing at random.)
- Two problems arise with complete-case analysis:
    1. If the units with missing values differ systematically from the completely observed cases, this could bias the complete-case analysis.
    2. If many variables are included in a model, there may be very few complete cases, so that most of the data would be discarded for the sake of a straightforward analysis.
- A related approach is *available-case* analysis where different aspects of a problem are studied with different subsets of the data, perhaps identified on the basis of what is missing in them.

## Single Imputation

In **single imputation** analyses, NA values are estimated/replaced *one time* with *one particular data value* for the purpose of obtaining more complete samples, at the expense of creating some potential bias in the eventual conclusions or obtaining slightly *less* accurate estimates than would be available if there were no missing values in the data.

- A single imputation can be just a replacement with the mean or median (for a quantity) or the mode (for a categorical variable.) However, such an approach, though easy to understand, underestimates variance and ignores the relationship of missing values to other variables.
- Single imputation can also be done using a variety of models to try to capture information about the NA values that are available in other variables within the data set.
- The `simputation` package can help us execute single imputations using a wide variety of techniques, within the pipe approach used by the `tidyverse`. Another approach I have used in the past is the `mice` package, which can also perform single imputations.

## Multiple Imputation

**Multiple imputation**, where NA values are repeatedly estimated/replaced with multiple data values, for the purpose of obtaining mode complete samples *and* capturing details of the variation inherent in the fact that the data have missingness, so as to obtain *more* accurate estimates than are possible with single imputation.

- We'll postpone the discussion of multiple imputation for a while.

## Building a Complete Case Analysis

We can drop all of the missing values from a data set with `drop_na` or with `na.omit` or by filtering for `complete.cases`. Any of these approaches produces the same result - a new data set with 9 rows (after dropping the six subjects with any NA values) and 5 columns.

```{r}
cc.1 <- na.omit(sbp_example)
cc.2 <- sbp_example %>% drop_na
cc.3 <- sbp_example %>% filter(complete.cases(.))
```

## Single Imputation with the Mean or Mode

The most straightforward approach to single imputation is to impute a single summary of the variable, such as the mean, median or mode. 

```{r}
skim(sbp_example)
```

Here, suppose we decide to impute

- `sbp.before` with the mean (143.33) among non-missing values,
- `diabetes` with its median (1) among non-missing values, and
- `treat` with its most common value, or mode (A)

```{r}
si.1 <- sbp_example %>%
    replace_na(list(sbp.before = 143.33,
                    diabetes = 1,
                    treat = "A"))
si.1
```

We could accomplish the same thing with, for example:

```{r}
si.2 <- sbp_example %>%
    replace_na(list(sbp.before = mean(sbp_example$sbp.before, na.rm = TRUE),
                    diabetes = median(sbp_example$diabetes, na.rm = TRUE),
                    treat = "A"))
```

## Doing Single Imputation with `simputation`

Single imputation is a potentially appropriate method when missingness can be assumed to be either completely at random (MCAR) or dependent only on observed predictors (MAR). We'll use the `simputation` package to accomplish it.

- The `simputation` vignette is available at https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/simputation/vignettes/intro.html
- The `simputation` reference manual is available at https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/simputation/simputation.pdf

### Mirroring Our Prior Approach (imputing means/medians/modes)

Suppose we want to mirror what we did above, simply impute the mean for `sbp.before` and the median for `diabetes` again.

```{r}
si.3 <- sbp_example %>%
    impute_lm(sbp.before ~ 1) %>%
    impute_median(diabetes ~ 1) %>%
    replace_na(list(treat = "A"))

si.3
```

### Using a model to impute `sbp.before` and `diabetes`

Suppose we wanted to use:

- a robust linear model to predict `sbp.before` missing values, on the basis of `sbp.after` and `diabetes` status, and
- a predictive mean matching approach to predict `diabetes` status, on the basis of `sbp.after`, and 
- a decision tree approach to predict `treat` status, using all other variables in the data

```{r}
set.seed(50001)

imp.4 <- sbp_example %>%
    impute_rlm(sbp.before ~ sbp.after + diabetes) %>%
    impute_pmm(diabetes ~ sbp.after) %>%
    impute_cart(treat ~ .)

imp.4
```

Details on the many available methods in `simputation` are provided [in its manual](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/simputation/simputation.pdf). These include:

- `impute_cart` uses a Classification and Regression Tree approach for numerical or categorical data. There is also an `impute_rf` command which uses Random Forests for imputation.
- `impute_pmm` is one of several "hot deck" options for imputation, this one is predictive mean matching, which can be used with numeric data (only). Missing values are first imputed using a predictive model. Next, these predictions are replaced with the observed values which are nearest to the prediction. Other imputation options in this group include random hot deck, sequential hot deck and k-nearest neighbor imputation.
- `impute_rlm` is one of several regression imputation methods, including linear models, robust linear models (which use what is called M-estimation to impute numerical variables) and lasso/elastic net/ridge regression models. 

The `simputation` package can also do EM-based multivariate imputation, and multivariate random forest imputation, and several other approaches.
