# Modeling a Count Outcome in Ohio SMART

In this chapter, I use a count outcome (# of poor physical health days out of the last 30) to demonstrate regression models for count outcomes. 

Methods discussed in the chapter include the following:

- Ordinary Least Squares
- Poisson Regression
- Overdispersed Quasi-Poisson Regression
- Negative Binomial Regression
- Zero-Inflated Poisson Regression
- Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial Regression
- Hurdle Models with Poisson counts
- Hurdle Models with Negative Binomial counts
- Tobit Regression
